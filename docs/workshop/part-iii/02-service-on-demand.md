## What is a Promise Workflow? {#what-is-a-workflow}

A [Kratix Promise](../main/reference/promises/intro) is configured with a collection of Workflows, defined as `workflows` in the Promise definition.

It's possible to trigger Workflows at different stages of the Promise or Resource lifecycle. In this workshop, you will focus on the Workflow for `resource.configure`. This Workflow will run whenever a user makes a request to your Promise API, for example when someone requests an Elastic Cloud Kubernetes (ECK) Resource.

Kratix provides a straightforward way to define Workflows as Pipelines, though you can use other technologies (such as Tekton) if you prefer.

The Kratix Pipeline is essentially an ordered list of OCI-compliant images. Each image runs as an init container within a single Kubernetes pod and therefore is limited only by what actions you can take inside a Pod in Kubernetes. This means you can download software, run imperative commands, wait for manual approvals and more.

<figure class="diagram">
  <PipelineDiagram className="large"/>
  <figcaption>An example multi-stage Pipeline</figcaption>
</figure>

In addition to running commands within the images, when using a Kratix Pipeline you will also be provided a few key files conventions:

- `/kratix/input`: Kratix will add the user's request into this directory as `object.yaml`.
- `/kratix/output`: The files in this directory will be scheduled to a matching Kratix Destination.
- `/kratix/metadata/destination-selectors.yaml`: A YAML document containing the extra matchers to be used by Kratix when determining which destination should run this workload.
- `/kratix/metadata/status.yaml`: A YAML document that will be written to the Resource `status` section on Pipeline completion.

This step of the workshop will focus on defining a script that the Kratix Pipeline container runs and the files defined in the output directory. Both `destination-selectors` and `status` will be explored in an upcoming section of this workshop.

### Design principles

A Workflow, and more specifically a Kratix Pipeline, enables flexibility that can be best leveraged by keeping in mind a few key principles.

#### Reusability

Workflows are a great place to validate and enforce common requirements. For
example, if you write a stage that can check for necessary compliance
requirements, that stage can be used by all applicable Pipelines. In addition, you can write stages to check for excess costs, labeling conventions, security risks, and more.

While most Workflows will have at least one stage with logic unique to that Promise, building the Kratix Pipeline stages with reusability in mind is a great way to make your platform extensible.

#### Idempotency

An idempotent Workflow guarantees that running the same command multiple times will result in the same outcome. This is an important feature because they will be auto-reconciled on an ongoing basis.

Kubernetes controllers reconcile their objects in three scenarios:

- Object change
- Controller restart
- Default cadence

This means that yes, on every request for a Resource the Workflow will run. But also, it will run any time the controller is reset, as well as every 10 hours.

This means you will need to write your Workflows to make sure that rerunning them will not result in any adverse side effects.

<details>
  <summary>ü§î Wondering when to use Workflows versus creating a new Promise?</summary>

Platform design requires thinking about how to divide platform offerings into right sized Promises and evaluating options for reusability and composability.

Each Promise is a the encapsulation of something as-a-Service. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that all platform users will want or need all types of Promises. It can be extremely helpful to create lower level Promises for services that are composed into a number of higher level offerings. For example, a Kubernetes Promise may never be something requested by an application developer, but it may be that a number of software Promises like ‚Äúenvironment‚Äù, or ‚Äúdata store‚Äù depend on a Kubernetes cluster that can be provisioned using a Promise.

Promises are not the only way to create reusable components when designing your platform with Kratix. You can also create reusable Pipeline stages that can be run in a number of different Promise Workflows. For example, you may want to add default labels to certain types of resources. You can create a Pipeline stage which evaluates the resources set to be declared at the end of the Workflow and apply consistent labelling before writing.

Since both Promises and Workflows can be reused, you may wonder when to use each. The best rule of thumb is to ask if you are describing a noun or a verb.

Nouns are most easily described as _things_. A database is a thing, so is a cluster, or an application, or any number of software offerings your platform may support. If you are trying to provide some_thing_ as-a-Service you should be thinking about creating a Promise.

Verbs can be described as _actions_. Labelling, notifying, or scanning can all be actions you may want to take rather than things you want to create. These actions can often be made across multiple things, e.g. you may want to label both databases and queues. When you are trying to take action to fulfil a cross-cutting concern, this is most suited to a Workflow step.

Like all rules of thumb, this should be treated as a guide. When it comes to system design it is important that it works for your context and the Syntasso team is happy to work with you as you approach these discussions as a team.

Now that you understand what you can do in a Workflow and some design principles for writing images, it is time to write your own Workflow to deliver on-demand Elastic Clouds! At the end of this section you will have an API which calls a Workflow and results in declarative files being written to a state store.

## Codify your delivery process in a Container {#write-docker-container}

To provision Elastic Cloud Kubernetes (ECK) you will need to both install the
operator and use the ECK-stack Helm chart to make requests to the operator. By
encapsulating the process in a Container you are able to manage quite complex
actions while also having access to a testable interface.

### Write the script to run your Kratix Pipeline

Defining a Pipeline requires a number of files and scripts. For that reason it is best to create a subfolder to organise these specific items.

More specifically, the first two files you will need are:

- `run`: a script containing the code that will be executed when the Workflow runs.
- `default-config.yaml`: a values document containing configuration options for the default ElasticSearch and Kibana.
- `beats-values.yaml`: a values document containing configuration options for when the Data Collection is enabled.

To create the subfolder and these two executable files, you can run the following command:

```bash
mkdir -p pipeline
touch pipeline/run pipeline/default-config.yaml pipeline/beats-values.yaml
chmod +x pipeline/run
```

Next you will write the code that manages the provisioning process in the `run`
script. Paste the contents below in the `pipeline/run` script:

```bash title="pipeline/run"
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -eu -o pipefail

mkdir -p to-deploy
export name="$(yq eval '.metadata.name' /kratix/input/object.yaml)"
export enableDataCollection="$(yq eval '.spec.enableDataCollection' /kratix/input/object.yaml)"

echo "Downloading CRDS..."
curl --silent --location --output to-deploy/elastic-crds.yaml \
    https://download.elastic.co/downloads/eck/2.8.0/crds.yaml

echo "Downloading Operator..."
curl --silent --location --output to-deploy/elastic-operator.yaml \
    https://download.elastic.co/downloads/eck/2.8.0/operator.yaml

echo "Generate ECK requests..."
# Only set the beats value file if data collection is enabled
valuesFile=''
if $enableDataCollection; then
  sed "s/NAME/${name}/g" beats-values.yaml > beats-final-values.yaml
  valuesFile='--values beats-final-values.yaml'
fi

nodePort="$(echo "${name}" | md5sum | grep -Eo "[[:digit:]]{3}" | head -n1)"
nodePort=$(( 30000 + nodePort ))
sed "s/NODEPORT/${nodePort}/g" default-config.yaml | sed "s/NAME/${name}/g" > default-config-final-values.yaml

helm template $name eck-stack \
  $valuesFile \
  --values default-config-final-values.yaml \
  --repo https://helm.elastic.co \
  --output-dir to-deploy

echo "Adding namespaces to all helm output files..."
find /pipeline/to-deploy/eck-stack -name \*.yaml   -exec yq -i 'select(.metadata | has("namespace") | not).metadata.namespace |= "default"' {} \;

echo "Removing enterprise annotation..."
find /pipeline/to-deploy/eck-stack -name \*.yaml   -exec yq -i 'del(.metadata.annotations["eck.k8s.elastic.co/license"])' {} \;


echo "Copying files to /kratix/output..."
find /pipeline/to-deploy -name \*.yaml -exec cp {} /kratix/output \;

if [ -f /kratix/output/beats.yaml ]; then
  head -n -1 /kratix/output/beats.yaml > temp.yaml ; mv temp.yaml /kratix/output/beats.yaml
fi

echo "Done"
```

Next, populate the `default-config.yaml` document. This is file contains default
configuration for the Kibana deployment. The NodePort will be injected by the
pipeline:

```yaml title=pipeline/default-config.yaml
eck-elasticsearch:
  fullnameOverride: NAME
eck-kibana:
  fullnameOverride: NAME
  spec:
    config:
      csp:
        strict: false
    count: 1
    elasticsearchRef:
      name: NAME
    http:
      tls:
        selfSignedCertificate:
          disabled: true
      service:
        spec:
          type: NodePort
          ports: [{ nodePort: NODEPORT, port: 5601, name: http }]
```

Next, populate the `beats-values.yaml` document. Paste the following into the
`pipeline/beats-values.yaml` file:

```yaml title="pipeline/beats-values.yaml"
eck-beats:
  enabled: true
  fullnameOverride: NAME
  spec:
    type: metricbeat
    elasticsearchRef:
      name: NAME
    kibanaRef:
      name: NAME
    config:
      filebeat.inputs: []
      metricbeat:
        modules:
        - module: system
          period: 10s
          metricsets:
          - cpu
          - load
          - memory
          - network
          - process
          - process_summary
          process:
            include_top_n:
              by_cpu: 5
              by_memory: 5
          processes:
          - .*
    daemonSet:
      podTemplate:
        spec:
          containers:
            - args:
                - -e
                - -c
                - /etc/beat.yml
                - -system.hostfs=/hostfs
              name: metricbeat
          initContainers:
            - name: elastic-internal-init-keystore
              securityContext:
                runAsNonRoot: false
                runAsUser: 0
              command:
                - sh
                - '-c'
                - 'chown -R 1000:1000 /usr/share/beat/data'
              image: 'docker.elastic.co/beats/filebeat:8.7.0'
              name: permissions
              securityContext:
                runAsUser: 0
              volumeMounts:
                - mountPath: /usr/share/beat/data
                  name: beat-data
          securityContext:
            fsGroup: 1000
            runAsGroup: 1000
            runAsUser: 1000

```

<details>
<summary>ü§î How does the run script work?</summary>
Take a look at the file you have just created and see how the principles and structures introduced above are applied.

On line 11 and line 15 the script is downloading a specific version of ECK rather than using a mutable tag like `latest`. This means that no matter how frequently this image runs, it will always generate the same output.

In addition, on line 34 the files that should be deployed to the cluster are copied to `/kratix/output`. You may wonder why these files were not downloaded and created directly to the `output` directory. This is an good practice that allows you to use a temporary directory to download and possibly manipulate files before finalising them in the `output` directory.

Finally, you can see that on lines 6 and 7 the script is capturing values from the Resource definition and using those values to customise the outputs. Specifically, it is using the Resource name to make sure that the resources have unique names, and using the user provided API value to decide on line 45 if Beats should be installed.

</details>

Your shell script is nearly testable as is. However one complication is the manipulation of the root file system. Therefore, the next step will be to package this script into a Dockerfile which will enable testing and also make it ready for use in your Kratix Pipeline.

:::tip

Remember there is no limitation to the languages you use in this script. You may prefer more complete programming and scripting languages like Golang, Python, or Elixir as your logic becomes more robust.

:::

### Write the Dockerfile

A [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) manages both build and runtime requirements for your container.

To create your Dockerfile in the `pipeline` directory run the following command:

```bash
touch pipeline/Dockerfile
```

Next, paste the contents below into the newly created `pipeline/Dockerfile`:

```docker
FROM "alpine"
WORKDIR /pipeline

RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache bash curl openssl yq
RUN curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3 \
    && chmod +x get_helm.sh && ./get_helm.sh

ADD run /pipeline/run
ADD beats-values.yaml /pipeline/beats-values.yaml
ADD default-config.yaml /pipeline/default-config.yaml

RUN chmod +x /pipeline/run

CMD [ "sh", "-c", "/pipeline/run" ]
ENTRYPOINT []
```

At this stage, your `elastic-cloud-promise` directory should look like this:

```
üìÇ elastic-cloud-promise
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pipeline
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ beats-values.yaml
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ default-config.yaml
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ run
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ promise.yaml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ resource-request.yaml
```

<details>
<summary>ü§î How does the Dockerfile work?</summary>

Take a look at the created file and you can see on line 1 that this is an Alpine
Linux container that requires `bash`, `curl` and `yq` to be installed on line 4.
This allows you to install Helm on line 5 before calling your `run` script on
each run via the `CMD` declaration on line 14 after adding to the image on line 9.

</details>

## Test the Pipeline container {#test-the-pipeline}

Now that the script is packaged as a Dockerfile, you are able to run the script without impacting your local root directory.

In order run a test you will need to:

- Mimic the `/kratix/output` directory locally
- Provide the expected input files (the Resource definition)
- Build the image
- Run the container
- Validate the files in the `output` directory

Start by creating the files and test structure:

```
mkdir -p test/{input,output,metadata}
```

As an example input, copy the Resource definition as `object.yaml` into the `input`
directory:

```bash
cp resource-request.yaml test/input/object.yaml
```

At this stage, your directory structure should look like this:

```
üìÇ elastic-cloud-promise
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pipeline
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ beats-values.yaml
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ default-config.yaml
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ run
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ promise.yaml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resource-request.yaml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ input
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ object.yaml
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ metadata
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ output
```

### Create simple test suite

Now that you have your local directories all set up, it is time to actually
build, run and validate the image outputs.

Here is where another convenience script can be helpful. By creating a build
and test script you will be able to consistently run the necessary commands
and expand on them as you may want to automate more of your testing.

Use the following command to once again set up the necessary local file structure:

```bash
mkdir -p scripts
touch scripts/build-pipeline scripts/test-pipeline
chmod +x scripts/*
```

Paste the following in `scripts/build-pipeline`:

```bash title="scripts/build-pipeline"
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -eu -o pipefail

testdir=$(cd "$(dirname "$0")"/../test; pwd)

docker build --tag kratix-workshop/elastic-pipeline:dev $testdir/../pipeline
kind load docker-image --name platform kratix-workshop/elastic-pipeline:dev
```

Paste the following in `scripts/test-pipeline`

```bash title="scripts/test-pipeline"
#!/usr/bin/env bash

scriptsdir=$(cd "$(dirname "$0")"; pwd)
testdir=$(cd "$(dirname "$0")"/../test; pwd)
inputDir="$testdir/input"
outputDir="$testdir/output"
metadataDir="$testdir/metadata"

$scriptsdir/build-pipeline
rm $outputDir/*

docker run --rm --volume ${outputDir}:/kratix/output --volume ${inputDir}:/kratix/input --volume ${metadataDir}:/kratix/metadata kratix-workshop/elastic-pipeline:dev
```

These scripts do the following:

- `build-pipeline` codifies the dev tag for the image and how to build it. It will also load the container image on the KinD cluster.
- `test-pipeline` calls build-pipeline and also runs the image, allowing you to verify the created files in the `test/output` directory.

At this stage, your directory structure should look like this:

```
üìÇ elastic-cloud-promise
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pipeline
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ beats-values.yaml
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ default-config.yaml
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ run
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ promise.yaml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resource-request.yaml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build-pipeline
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test-pipeline
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ input
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ object.yaml
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ metadata
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ output
```

### Run the test

To execute the test, run the script with the following command:

```bash
./scripts/test-pipeline
```

Which should build and run the image. Once the execution completes,
verify the `test/output` directory. You should see the following files:

```bash
üìÇ elastic-cloud-promise
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ input
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ object.yaml
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ output
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ beats.yaml
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ elastic-crds.yaml
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ elastic-operator.yaml
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ elasticsearch.yaml
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ kibana.yaml
```

You can take a look at the files and verify their contents. If everything looks
good, your image is ready to be included in your Promise.

:::tip Testing Pipeline images

As you just experience, testing images is really simple. You can
quickly validate that the stage is outputting exactly what you want, without
even touching Kubernetes.

The ability to treat images as independent pieces of software that can
have their own development lifecycle (fully testable, easy to execute locally,
release independent) allows platform teams to move faster, sharing and reusing
images across their Promises.

:::

## Include this container in your Promise Workflow {#add-container-to-workflow}

With your Pipeline tested you are ready to add it to your Promise. To do this,
you will add a new top level key in the Promise `spec` as a sibling to the
`api` key you created in the last section.

The key should be `workflows` and should contain a list of your
pipelines containers which will be just one for now:

```yaml title="promise.yaml -- include it under the 'spec' key"
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: Promise
metadata:
  name: elastic-cloud
spec:
  #highlight-start

## Install the Promise {#install-promise}

### Prerequisite setup

<PartialVerifyKratixWithOutPromises />

### Install the Promise

You can now install the updated Promise:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM create --filename promise.yaml
```

To validate the Promise has been installed, you can list all Promises by running:

```bash
kubectl --context kind-platform get promises
```

Your output will show the `elastic-cloud` Promise:

```shell-session
NAME            AGE
elastic-cloud   10s
```

## Request an on-demand Resource {#request-resource}

Now that the Promise is installed and includes a pipeline to provision the ECK Resources, you can switch hats to act like an application engineer who wants to request an monitoring stack Resource.

The request will result in the pipeline's output being installed on the worker cluster:

```mdx-code-block
import PipelineDiagram from "/img/docs/workshop/install-a-promise-pipeline.svg"
```

<figure class="diagram">
  <PipelineDiagram className="large"/>
  <figcaption>An example multi-stage Pipeline</figcaption>
</figure>

### Send a request for a Resource

You can use the same Resource definition as in the last section by running:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM apply --filename resource-request.yaml
```

You can once again see this request by listing all the request for elastic clouds using the following command:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM get elastic-cloud
```

The above command will give an output similar to:

```shell-session
NAME      STATUS
example   Pending
```

As an application engineer, you can see the Status as either `Pending` meaning that the provisioning is not yet complete, or `Resource requested` which indicates that the pipeline is complete. This is the basic status provided by Kratix, but you will be able to enhance this experience at a later step in this workshop.

### Verify the pipeline

As a platform engineer you can continue on to verify some of the processes behind the scenes. First of all, you can verify that the pipeline has been triggered by the request for a Resource. To see the pod run:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM get pods --show-labels
```

The output should look something like this:

```shell-session
NAME                                     READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE     LABELS
configure-pipeline-elastic-cloud-33029   0/1     Completed   0          1m   kratix-promise-id=elastic-cloud...
```

Within this pod there will be a number of containers including Kratix utility actions and the list of images you provided in the Promise.

To see the list of these containers in order of execution you can run:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM \
  get pods \
  --selector kratix-promise-id=elastic-cloud \
  --output jsonpath="{range .items[*].spec.initContainers[*]}{.name}{'\n'}{end}{range .items[*].spec.containers[*]}{.name}{'\n'}{end}"
```

Each container is listed in a row, in order that they occur so you should see:

```shell-session
reader
pipeline-stage-0
work-writer
status-writer
```

While you only provided a single image, you can see that there are four listed. Each has a job as follows:

- `reader` makes sure that the Resource definition is available to the pipeline
- `pipeline-stage-0` the container name you specified in the Kratix Pipeline
- `work-writer` schedules the files in the `output` directory based on the labels provided
- `status-writer` updates the Resource status

The most interesting container for you will be the one you created, the `pipeline-stage-0` container. To see the logs from this specific container you can run:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM logs \
  --selector kratix-promise-id=elastic-cloud \
  --container pipeline-stage-0
```

The logs will look something like this:

```shell-session
Downloading Operator...
Generate ECK requests...
wrote to-deploy/eck-stack/charts/eck-beats/templates/beats.yaml
wrote to-deploy/eck-stack/charts/eck-elasticsearch/templates/elasticsearch.yaml
wrote to-deploy/eck-stack/charts/eck-kibana/templates/kibana.yaml

Adding namespaces to all helm output files...
Removing enterprise annotation...
Copying files to /kratix/output...
Done
```

### Verify the worker

While it is useful to verify the container has run by viewing the logs, the outcome you most want to verify is the scheduling and creation of an ECK Resource.

To see this you will need to check the worker cluster where the ECK server was scheduled. First you may want to verify that the operator is running:

```bash
kubectl --context $WORKER get pods -n elastic-system
```

With the following output:

```shell-session
NAME                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
elastic-operator-0   1/1     Running   0          1m
```

With all the necessary CRDs installed:

```bash
kubectl --context $WORKER get crds | grep elastic
```

which will result in something like:

```shell-session
agents.agent.k8s.elastic.co                            2023-01-01T12:00:00Z
apmservers.apm.k8s.elastic.co                          2023-01-01T12:00:00Z
beats.beat.k8s.elastic.co                              2023-01-01T12:00:00Z
elasticmapsservers.maps.k8s.elastic.co                 2023-01-01T12:00:00Z
elasticsearchautoscalers.autoscaling.k8s.elastic.co    2023-01-01T12:00:00Z
elasticsearches.elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co           2023-01-01T12:00:00Z
enterprisesearches.enterprisesearch.k8s.elastic.co     2023-01-01T12:00:00Z
kibanas.kibana.k8s.elastic.co                          2023-01-01T12:00:00Z
logstashes.logstash.k8s.elastic.co                     2023-01-01T12:00:00Z
stackconfigpolicies.stackconfigpolicy.k8s.elastic.co   2023-01-01T12:00:00Z
```

Finally, you will want to see the provisioned Resource by running:

```bash
kubectl --context $WORKER get pods --watch
```

The above command will give an output similar to (it may take a while for the
pods to be ready):

```shell-session
NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
example-es-default-0                     1/1     Running   0          5m
example-beat-metricbeat-frpv7            1/1     Running   0          5m
example-eck-kibana-kb-6f4f95b787-4fqsr   1/1     Running   0          5m
```

Once the Ready column reports `1/1`, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to
exit the watch mode.

Go to <http://localhost:30269> and check it out!

:::info
If you are in Instruqt, you can just navigate to the `üîó ECK Instance` tab and use the refresh button on the top left.
:::

You can even login by using the default username `elastic` and retrieving the password from the worker cluster with the following command:

```bash
kubectl --context $WORKER \
  get secret example-es-elastic-user \
  --output go-template='{{.data.elastic | base64decode}}'
```

:::caution
If you gave your ECK Resource a different name, you may need port-forwarding to access the running instance:

kubectl --context $WORKER port-forward deploy/NAME-kb 8080:30269

### Trying to request a second resource

The power of Kratix is the scalability of self-service, on-demand Resources.
Therefore, it is expected that any Promise will have more than one request for Resources made to it.

To see how the current Promise responds to a second request, you will need to
make a second request with the a new name:

```bash
cat resource-request.yaml | \
  sed 's/name: example/name: second-request/' | \
  kubectl --context $PLATFORM apply --filename -
```

Once again, you can verify this request by listing elastic-clouds:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM get elastic-clouds
```

Which should now show a second Resource in the list:

```shell-session
NAME             STATUS
example          Resource requested
second-request   Resource requested
```

You can also see that a second pipeline has run by checking the pods:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM get pods
```

However, when you go to check the status on the worker cluster, you will not see a second elastic cloud Resource:

```bash
kubectl --context $WORKER get pods
```

This is because our pipeline is not outputting resources that can be applied to the same cluster multiple times. Our pipeline outputs two sets of resources:

- The operator and its CRDs
- The request to the operator (helm output)

Operators are only designed to be installed once per cluster, because each run of the pipeline is outputting we are getting a failure were the resources we are trying to schedule to the cluster aren't compatible. Take a look at the feedback our GitOps reconciler is giving back:

```bash
kubectl --context $WORKER get kustomizations -n flux-system
```

The above command will give an output similar to:

```shell-session
NAME                         AGE   READY   STATUS
kratix-worker-dependencies   49m   True    Applied revision: d26ce528a44746fe33e771659662fd2217e3ae74c0744203a334cc69d1f7f30a
kratix-worker-resources      49m   False   kustomize build failed: accumulating resources: accumulation err='merging resources from './default/elastic-cloud/second-request/elastic-crds.yaml': may not add resource with an already registered id: CustomResourceDefinition.v1.apiextensions.k8s.io/agents.agent.k8s.elastic.co.[noNs]': must build at directory: '/tmp/kustomization-3151309318/worker-1/resources/default/elastic-cloud/second-request/elastic-crds.yaml': file is not directory
```

The key part being `may not add resource with an already registered id: CustomResourceDefinition.v1.apiextensions.k8s.io/agents.agent.k8s.elastic.co.[noNs]'`, the GitOps reconciler detects its trying to install the same resource (CRD) twice and errors. In the next section we will tackle separating out Dependencies from requests.
