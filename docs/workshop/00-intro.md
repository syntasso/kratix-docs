## Welcome

<img align="right" src={useBaseUrl('/img/logo_300_with-padding.png')} />

This workshop introduces you to the [Kratix](https://www.kratix.io) framework.
Over a series of tutorials you will build a deeper understanding of what
Kratix is, how Kratix works, and how you can use Kratix to deliver a first-class
platform within your organisation.

Before beginning this workshop, consider your answers to the following questions:

- What is the highest value service your platform provides to your application development teams?
- How easy is it for you to provide and maintain that service?
- How easy is it for application developers to use that service?
- How can you enhance flow for your application developers and reduce effort for you and your platform team?

We hope that, by going through the workshop and learning Kratix's concepts, it
will become evident how you could incorporate Kratix into your platform to
provide a better developer experience.

## The series
