## What is Kratix?

Kratix is a framework that enables co-creation of capabilities by providing a
clear contract between application and platform teams through the definition and
creation of "Promises". Kratix focuses on empowering platform engineers to build
better platforms. The following video provides a high-level overview of Kratix:

## Hands on: Installing Kratix

Before continuing, be sure to go back to the [prerequisites](../prerequisites/intro)
and follow the guide if you haven't done so already.

You should also make sure you are currently in the `kratix` directory and have
the following environment variables set:

```bash
export PLATFORM="kind-platform"
export WORKER="kind-worker"
```

This guide will go through the following steps:

1. [Installing Kratix](#install-kratix)
1. [Create the Kratix State Store](#statestore-setup)

### Install Kratix

To install Kratix, all you need is the Kratix distribution file.

Run the command below to deploy Kratix on the platform cluster:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM apply --filename https://github.com/syntasso/kratix/releases/latest/download/kratix.yaml
```

This command will create a Kratix deployment (in the `kratix-platform-system`
namespace). It will also install all the APIs (as Kubernetes CRDs) that Kratix
needs.

Verify that the Kratix CRDs are available:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM get crds | grep kratix
```

The above command will give an output similar to:

```shell-session
bucketstatestores.platform.kratix.io   2023-01-22T11:53:15Z
destinations.platform.kratix.io        2023-01-22T11:53:15Z
gitstatestores.platform.kratix.io      2023-01-22T11:53:15Z
promisereleases.platform.kratix.io     2023-01-22T11:53:15Z
promises.platform.kratix.io            2023-01-22T11:53:15Z
workplacements.platform.kratix.io      2023-01-22T11:53:15Z
works.platform.kratix.io               2023-01-22T11:53:15Z
```

<details>
<summary>What are CRDs?</summary>

A Custom Resource (CR) is an extension of the Kubernetes API that is not
necessarily available in a default Kubernetes installation. It represents a
customisation of a particular Kubernetes installation.

A Custom Resource Definition (CRD) is the object you create to teach your
Kubernetes cluster about this new API.

Kratix comes with multiple API extensions (CRDs), as you can see above.

Check the Kubernetes documentation for further details on [Custom
Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)
and [Custom Resources
Definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/).

</details>

Verify the Kratix deployment:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM get deployments --namespace kratix-platform-system
```

The above command will give an output similar to:

```shell-session
NAME                                 READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
kratix-platform-controller-manager   1/1     1            1           1h
```

You can now tell Kratix which repositories it will use to deploy and manage the
workloads.

### Create the Kratix State Store {#statestore-setup}

The State Store represents the various backing storage options to which Kratix
can write. When registering a Worker cluster with Kratix, you will need to
specify the State Store you intend to use. Kratix will then write to the
specified State Store when scheduling workloads for deployment on that cluster.

Create a new State Store that points to the MinIO bucket created in the
[prerequisites](../prerequisites/create-clusters#minio-as-the-gitops-repository):

```yaml
cat << EOF | kubectl --context $PLATFORM apply -f -
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: BucketStateStore
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  endpoint: minio.kratix-platform-system.svc.cluster.local
  insecure: true
  bucketName: kratix
  secretRef:
    name: minio-credentials
    namespace: default
EOF
```

The above command will give an output similar to:

```shell-session
bucketstatestore.platform.kratix.io/default created
```

<details>
<summary>More on the Kratix State Store</summary>

The State Store document contains the configuration needed to access the actual
backing storage.

In the example above, you created a new `BucketStateStore` as a MinIO bucket
has been provisioned for storage, but you could use any other S3-compatible
storage like Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage.

The `spec` includes the details needed to access that specific kind of State
Store. On the example above, you configured the `endpoint` to the cluster
address of the MinIO server you deployed on the platform cluster. Since MinIO
is running in-cluster and without TLS enabled, it is necessary to set `insecure`
to true.

You can see the MinIO service on the `kratix-platform-system`:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM --namespace kratix-platform-system get service minio
```

The above command will give an output similar to:

```shell-session
NAME    TYPE       CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
minio   NodePort   10.96.96.166   <none>        80:31337/TCP   17h
```

`bucketName` refers to the actual bucket on the MinIO server. The bucket needs
to exist prior to Kratix trying to use it. As a part of setting up MinIO you
ran a Job to create the base `kratix` bucket.

Finally, `secretRef` points to a [Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/),
in the same namespace as the State Store, containing the credentials to access
the store. For `BucketStateStore`, Kratix expects to find an `accessKeyID` and
a `secretAccessKey` when resolving the secret. As part of the MinIO deployment,
you also created the necessary Secret:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM describe secret minio-credentials
```

The above command will give an output similar to:

```shell-session
Name:         minio-credentials
Namespace:    default
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  <none>

Type:  Opaque

Data
====
accessKeyID:      10 bytes
secretAccessKey:  10 bytes
```

For further details on State Stores, check the [State Store documentation
page](/main/reference/statestore/intro)

At this point, your environment looks like this (with a few components omitted
for clarity):

```mdx-code-block
import Topology01 from "/img/docs/workshop/topology-01.png"
```

<figure className="diagram">
  <img className="medium" src={Topology01} alt="Deployed resources with State Store" />

  <figcaption>Current environment: with Bucket State Store</figcaption>
</figure>

Although Kratix now knows about the State Store, it's not currently aware of any
place that the workloads can actually run: there's no _Destination_ registered
with the Platform cluster.

### Register the Worker cluster as a Destination {#destination-setup}

In Kratix terms, a _Destination_ is any system _converging_ on the state
declared by Kratix.

You have already created a worker cluster as part of the prerequisites. You will
now register this cluster as a Destination.

:::info

Note that the order of operations here is not important; you could have
registered the worker as a Destination first, and then created the Worker
cluster. Kratix would have scheduled to the State Store path representing the
Worker cluster, and the state would eventually be applied to a Worker.

:::

It's important to note that Kratix makes no assumptions about the Destinations
hemselves. Although Destinations are often Kubernetes clusters, they may be any
system that can interpret whatever state is being declared as desired.

For example, you may write a Promise that tells Kratix to declare Terraform
plans as desired state, and a Destination may be a system applying these
plans as they are written to the State Store.

To register the worker cluster, create a `Destination` object on your Platform
cluster:

```yaml
cat <<EOF | kubectl --context $PLATFORM apply --filename -
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: Destination
metadata:
   name: worker-cluster
   labels:
    environment: dev
spec:
  path: worker-cluster
  stateStoreRef:
     name: default
     kind: BucketStateStore
EOF
```

The above command will give an output similar to:

```shell-session
destinations.platform.kratix.io/worker-cluster created
```

<details>
<summary>Destinations in detail</summary>

The Kratix Destination resource is the representation of a system that workloads
can be scheduled to. Those systems are usually other Kubernetes clusters, but
can be any system that can interpret the declared state.

The only required field is `spec.stateStoreRef`, which contains a reference to a
State Store present in the platform. In this example, it points to the `default`
object you created on the previous step. The `spec.StateStoreRef.kind` specifies
the kind of State Store being used by this Destination.

This means that different Destinations can use different backing storage. For
example, you can have a set of Destinations backed by Git, while another set of
Destinations can be backed by a Bucket. Further configuration options pertaining
to paths are also available both in the [State Store](../../main/reference/statestore/intro)
and the [Destination object](../../main/reference/destinations/intro).

</details>

With the Destinations registered, Kratix now has a place where it can run
workloads!

In fact, as soon as a new Destination is registered, Kratix writes a test
document to the State Store. You can use this test to validate that the entire
system is wired up correctly.

First, check the MinIO `kratix` bucket:

```bash
mc ls -r kind
```

The above command will give an output similar to:

```shell-session
[2024-01-01 15:00:00 GMT]   116B STANDARD kratix/worker-cluster/dependencies/kratix-canary-namespace.yaml
[2024-01-01 15:00:00 GMT]   206B STANDARD kratix/worker-cluster/resources/kratix-canary-configmap.yaml
```

You can also inspect the contents of the test documents. For example, take the
`kratix-canary-namespace.yaml`:

```bash
mc cat kind/kratix/worker-cluster/dependencies/kratix-canary-namespace.yaml
```

The above command will give an output similar to:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: kratix-worker-system
spec: {}
status: {}
```

Since your Worker cluster is already listening to this path within the bucket,
you should see Flux automatically creating the namespace on the Worker cluster
as soon as it detects the change:

```bash
kubectl --context $WORKER get namespace kratix-worker-system
```

It may take a few minutes, but the above command will give an output similar to:

```shell-session
NAME                   STATUS   AGE
kratix-worker-system   Active   1m
```

You environment now looks like this:

```mdx-code-block
import Topology02 from "/img/docs/workshop/topology-02.png"
```

<figure className="diagram">
  <img className="large" src={Topology02} alt="Deployed resources with Destination" />

  <figcaption>Flux reconciled and created the test resources</figcaption>
</figure>

Kratix is now fully installed and configured, and can start deploying Promises
and [Resources](../../main/reference/resources/intro) to your clusters.
