## What is a Promise? {#what-is-a-promise}

In [Part I](../part-i/intro), you learned that Kratix is a framework used by platform teams to build platforms tailored to their organisation.

Kratix Promises are the encapsulation of platform offerings. They provide a structure to manage the complexities of providing _something-as-a-service_, including the definition of how a user can request a Resource, the steps to provision the requested Resource, and how to provide access to the Resource.

Promises allow platform teams to:

- Define an API, including versioning and validation
- Execute imperative commands per the user request
- Use GitOps to continuously reconcile delivered services
- Install and configure (or verify) dependencies for delivering a service
- Manage where services are deployed across the infrastructure (on and
  off-Kubernetes, on Cloud providers, etc)

### Promise Architecture

Before jumping into writing a Promise, here is a quick review of the Promise Architecture.

```mdx-code-block
import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';
import PartialPromise from '../../_partials/_promise-architecture.md';
```

<PartialPromise />

As you go through building your own Promise, you will explore each of these four sections in detail.

## The Promise

In this tutorial, you are going to create a Promise that delivers Apps as a service. It will bundle the Kubernetes resources needed to run an application, namely a Deployment, Service, and Ingress.

For Ingress, you will use the [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx). This is a popular Ingress Controller that is used to expose Kubernetes services to the internet.

You can start thinking about your promise by designing the Promise API.

```mdx-code-block
import AppPromise from "/img/docs/workshop/part-ii-app-promise.png"
```

<figure className="diagram">
  <img className="medium" src={AppPromise} alt="The App Promise" />

  <figcaption>The App-as-a-Service Promise</figcaption>
</figure>

### Design an API for your service {#api-design}

When building an API, you have a lot of design considerations to include. For example, you will want to:

- require certain parameters
- make some parameters dependent on values in other parameters
- provide client-side validation
- run server-side validation
- ensure API versioning to manage updates

These and many other features are all provided as standard with a Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD). This is why Kratix uses CRDs as the mechanism to codify your Promise API.

:::info

In a Promise, the API is stored in a key called `api`

:::

<details>
<summary>ü§î Want to learn more about CRDs?</summary>

A Custom Resource (CR) is an extension of the Kubernetes API that is not necessarily available in a default Kubernetes installation. It represents a customisation of a particular Kubernetes installation.

A Custom Resource Definition (CRD) is the object you create to teach your Kubernetes cluster about this new resource type.

To read more about CRDs please refer to the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#create-a-customresourcedefinition).

This tutorial will not go through details on how to write a Kubernetes CRD, but you can check out the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#create-a-customresourcedefinition) for further details on the topic.

</details>

#### Start with the interface

A Kratix Promise allows platform teams to fine-tune how much application teams need to know about low-level details while still providing the levers they need to get the service they want.

You can start by defining an interface for the application teams to deploy their applications. This interface is the contract of what can be configured and within what parameters.

```mdx-code-block
import PromiseWayfinding from "/img/docs/workshop/part-ii-wayfinding-api-only.svg"
```

<figure className="diagram">
  <PromiseWayfinding className="small"/>

  <figcaption>The Promise API is where you will define the interface</figcaption>
</figure>

When designing the API for your new Promise, you can decide how much control you want to give to the application teams.

For example, you could allow them to configure all aspects of the underlying Deployment and Ingress rules. That option provides your users with maximum autonomy and configurability. However, it may be a lot to understand and misconfiguration of services can cause both cost and security issues in the future.

On the other hand, you could go to the other end of the spectrum, hiding all the options and asking users to provide only the absolutely necessary pieces of configuration. This allows for fewer configuration errors, but it also limits the flexibility of the service.

```mdx-code-block
import APISpectrum from "/img/docs/workshop/design-api-spectrum.svg"
```

<figure className="diagram">
  <APISpectrum className="large"/>

  <figcaption>The sweet spot for your organisation can be anywhere on the
  spectrum</figcaption>
</figure>

While both extremes are possible using Kratix, the recommendation is to design
your API with one key principle in mind: what do your users (need to) care
about? Answering that question is fundamental to designing a useful API.

#### Define your interface

At this stage, you decided to give users a very simple API. They can define:

- The container `image` of their app
- The `service.port` the application is listening on

For the Ingress, you decided to hide it altogether and provide a default configuration.

As previously mentioned, the Kratix Promise API is defined via a Kubernetes CRD. A deep dive on CRDs is out of scope for this tutorial, but you can read more about them in the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#create-a-customresourcedefinition).

To build the Promise, you can either write it yourself or bootstrap it with the [Kratix CLI](/main/kratix-cli/intro). In this workshop, you will use the CLI.

To keep the promise all in one place, create a directory called `app-promise` and run the `init promise` command inside it:

```bash
mkdir -p app-promise && cd app-promise
kratix init promise app --group workshop.kratix.io --version v1 --kind App
```

The command above should generate a `promise.yaml` file in the current directory. You can
check it out by running:

```bash
cat promise.yaml
```

Now, run the `update api` command to include the API fields you defined above:

```
kratix update api --property image:string --property service.port:integer
```

If you inspect the `promise.yaml` file again, you should see the API fields you defined
as a CRD:

```bash
cat promise.yaml | yq '.spec.api'
```

<details>
    <summary>Click here to see the Promise so far</summary>

```mdx-code-block
import PromiseWithAPI from "!!raw-loader!./_partials/writing-a-promise/02-promise-with-api.yaml"
```

<CodeBlock language="yaml" title="app-promise/promise.yaml">
  {PromiseWithAPI}
</CodeBlock>

</details>

Great! Your Promise now has an API. You can move on to the next step: defining the dependencies.

### Define the dependencies {#dependencies}

The next step is to define the dependencies of your Promise. This is where you will define the Kubernetes resources that will be created when the Promise is deployed.

As previously mentioned, this Promise will create a Deployment, a Service, and
an Ingress. Deployments and Services are built in to Kubernetes, so you can use
them directly. However, to use the NGINX Ingress Controller, you need to have it
installed on your worker cluster Destination _prior_ to any user deploying their applications.

That's exactly what Kratix dependencies are for: to define the resources that need to be created when the Promise is installed.

If you follow the NGINX Ingress Controller [installation instructions](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#provider-specific-steps), you will find that you need the resources defined in [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syntasso/kratix-docs/main/docs/workshop/part-ii/_partials/nginx-patched.yaml) installed on the cluster.

Create a subdirectory in your `app-promise` directory called `dependencies`. Then, create a file called `dependencies.yaml` and copy the contents of the file above into it.

```bash
mkdir -p dependencies
curl -o dependencies/dependencies.yaml --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syntasso/kratix-docs/main/docs/workshop/part-ii/_partials/nginx-patched.yaml
```

Once stored locally, you can declare the Promise Dependencies in your Promise Workflow.

#### Declare Promise Dependencies in Promise Workflow

You can rely on the Kratix CLI to create the Promise Workflow for you.

Run the following command:

```bash
kratix update dependencies ./dependencies/ --image kratix-workshop/app-promise-pipeline:v0.1.0
```

At this stage, your directory structure should look like this:

```
üìÇ app-promise
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dependencies
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dependencies.yaml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ example-resource.yaml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ promise.yaml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ promise
    ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ configure
    ‚îÇ¬†¬†     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dependencies
    ‚îÇ¬†¬†         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ configure-deps
    ‚îÇ¬†¬†             ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
    ‚îÇ¬†¬†             ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resources
    ‚îÇ¬†¬†             ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dependencies.yaml
    ‚îÇ¬†¬†             ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts
    ‚îÇ¬†¬†                 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pipeline.sh
...
```

The pipeline script generated by the CLI is already set up to deploy the dependencies into the Destinations. Check the `pipeline.sh` script for details.

#### Add the workflow to the Promise

The CLI already updated your Promise file with the Promise workflow.

Inspect it by running:

```bash
cat promise.yaml | yq '.spec.workflows'
```

Now, you'll need build the app-promise-pipeline image used in the `configure-deps` workflow and make it available in the container registry. Since you are
using kind clusters, you can build and load the image into the cluster directly by running the following commands:

```bash title="from the app-promise directory"
docker build --tag kratix-workshop/app-promise-pipeline:v0.1.0 workflows/promise/configure/dependencies/configure-deps
kind load docker-image kratix-workshop/app-promise-pipeline:v0.1.0 --name platform
```

Amazing! You are now one step away from having a working Promise. The next step is to define the Resource Workflow, that is, what must happen when a user requests a new app deployment.

### Define the Workflow {#workflow}

```mdx-code-block
import PromiseWorkflows from "/img/docs/workshop/part-ii-wayfinding-pipeline-only.svg"
```

<figure className="diagram">
  <PromiseWorkflows className="small"/>

  <figcaption>The Promise API is where you will define the interface</figcaption>
</figure>

Kratix provides several hooks for managing and customising the Promise's lifecycle. Those hooks are defined in the Promise `workflows` key. The minimum you need to define is what must happen when the platform receives a request for a new resource from the promised service. Refer to the [Workflows reference documentation](/main/reference/resources/workflows) for further details.

Kratix ships with a built-in Workflow kind, `Pipeline`, which provides a straightforward way to define Workflows. You could, however, use other tools (like Tekton) in your Workflows.

In a nutshell, a Kratix `Pipeline` is a series of containers that will be executed, in order. In this section, you will write and configure a Kratix `Pipeline` to be executed as part of the `resource.configure` Workflow.

When a user requests a new App deployment, the `resource.configure` Workflow will be executed. This workflow will query the user's input and declare the resources that must be created.

We will once again use the Kratix CLI to create the necessary files. Run the following command to bootstrap the skeleton of your Workflow:

```
kratix add container resource/configure/mypipeline --image kratix-workshop/app-pipeline-image:v1.0.0
```

The command above should have created a directory structure that looks like the following:

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dependencies
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dependencies.yaml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ example-resource.yaml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ promise.yaml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ resource
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ configure
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mypipeline
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ kratix-workshop-app-pipeline-image
                    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
                    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resources
                    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts
                        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pipeline.sh
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ promise
    ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ configure
    ‚îÇ¬†¬†     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dependencies
    ...
```

The CLI will create a basic `Dockerfile` and a `pipeline.sh` script. We will customise these files to fit our needs as we progress through the workshop. Feel free to explore them.

The generated Dockerfile uses the `alpine` image as a base image. As you progress through the Workshop, you will install the tools you need to execute the steps. You may also notice that image will execute a script called `pipeline.sh` when the container starts.

As we will use this same image to build several stages in the pipeline, let's rename the `pipeline.sh` to `resource-configure` to better reflect its purpose.

```bash
mv workflows/resource/configure/mypipeline/kratix-workshop-app-pipeline-image/scripts/{pipeline.sh,resource-configure}
```

Make sure to update the Dockerfile to reflect the new script name. Replace the Dockerfile contents with the snippet below:

```Dockerfile title="app-promise/workflows/resource/configure/mypipeline/kratix-workshop-app-pipeline-image/Dockerfile"
FROM "alpine"

RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache yq kubectl

COPY scripts/* /usr/bin/
ADD resources resources

RUN chmod +x /usr/bin/*

ENTRYPOINT []
```

Replace the contents of the `resource-configure` script with the following:

```mdx-code-block
import ExecutePipeline from "!!raw-loader!./_partials/writing-a-promise/04-resource-configure.sh"
```

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  title="app-promise/workflows/resource/configure/mypipeline/kratix-workshop-app-pipeline-image/scripts/resource-configure"
>
  {ExecutePipeline}
</CodeBlock>

As you can see, the script above uses the `kubectl` command to create a Deployment, a Service, and an Ingress. The script uses the `yq` command to extract the user's input from the `/kratix/input/object.yaml` file. The `object.yaml` file contains the input the user provided when requesting the new resource.

You may also notice that the script uses the `/kratix/output` directory to store the resources that must be created. At the end of the workflow, Kratix will deploy the resources stored in the `/kratix/output` directory to one of the available Destinations.

Finally, you can see this pipeline script is written in shell script. Kratix is unopinionated about the language you use to write your Pipelines. You can use any language you want as long as you provide a script that can be executed in a container.

:::info

It's straightforward to test your pipeline using `docker run` (or equivalent). You will learn how to do that in a later stage.

:::

When you ran the `kratix add container` command, the CLI automatically included the `workflow` key into the Promise, with the `resource.configure` Workflow defined. As you will add more scripts to the same image, open the `promise.yaml` and set the `command` key to the script you just created.

```mdx-code-block
import ResourceWorkflow from "!!raw-loader!./_partials/writing-a-promise/05-resource-workflow.yaml"
```

<CodeBlock language="yaml" title="app-promise/promise.yaml">
  {ResourceWorkflow}
</CodeBlock>

The final step is to actually build the Resource Configure Workflow's pipeline image and make it available in the container registry. Similar to when you built the Promise Configure Workflow's Pipeline image, you can build and load the image into the cluster directly by running the following commands:

```bash title="from the app-promise directory"
docker build --tag kratix-workshop/app-pipeline-image:v1.0.0 workflows/resource/configure/mypipeline/kratix-workshop-app-pipeline-image
kind load docker-image kratix-workshop/app-pipeline-image:v1.0.0 --name platform
```

And that's it! You have now defined a Promise that can be used to deploy a new App.

import FullPromise from "!!raw-loader!./_partials/writing-a-promise/06-full-promise.yaml"
```

<CodeBlock language="yaml" title="app-promise/promise.yaml">
  {FullPromise}
</CodeBlock>

</details>

### Install the Promise {#install-the-promise}

Go ahead and install the Promise in the platform:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM apply --filename promise.yaml
```

As part of the Promise configure Workflow, you have included the NGINX Ingress
Controller. You can check that it got installed in the worker cluster
Destination correctly by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl --context $WORKER get deployments --namespace ingress-nginx
```

It may take a couple of minutes, but you will eventually see an output similar to:

```shell-session
NAME                       READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
ingress-nginx-controller   1/1     1            1           2m8s
```

You can switch hats now and assume the role of an App developer trying to deploy their application.

```mdx-code-block
import PromiseInstalled from "/img/docs/workshop/part-ii-promise-installed.png"
```

<figure className="diagram">
  <img className="large" src={PromiseInstalled} alt="Clusters with a Promise
  installed" />

  <figcaption>Dependencies being scheduled to the Destination</figcaption>
</figure>

## Using the App Promise {#using-the-app-promise}

As a developer, you can check the available promises by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM get promises
```

The above command should output the following:

```shell-session
NAME   STATUS      KIND   API VERSION             VERSION
app    Available   App    workshop.kratix.io/v1
```

You can see that the `app` Promise is available. Great! You can deploy your app by providing an `image` and a `service.port`.

The CLI should've created an `example-resource.yaml` file in the `app-promise` directory. You can use this file to request a new App deployment. If the file is not there, you can create it by running the following command:

```bash
touch example-resource.yaml
```

Open the file in your editor and add the following content:

```yaml title="app-promise/example-resource.yaml"
apiVersion: workshop.kratix.io/v1
kind: App
metadata:
  name: todo
  namespace: default
spec:
  image: syntasso/sample-todo:v0.1.0
  service:
    port: 8080
```

Then, submit the request by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM apply --filename example-resource.yaml
```

Kratix will receive the request and execute the workflow defined in the Promise. You can verify the workflow by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM get pods
```

The above command should output something similar to:

```shell-session
NAME                                       READY   STATUS      RESTARTS      AGE
kratix-app-todo-resource-configure-029c3-5tmbq     0/1     Completed   0             1m
```

It may take a few seconds for the pod to appear, but it will eventually show as Completed. At this stage, Kratix will schedule the workflow outputs to the worker cluster. You should see the App getting deployed on the Worker with the following command:

```bash
kubectl --context $WORKER get deployments
```

The above command should output something similar to (it may take a couple of
minutes):

```shell-session
NAME   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
todo   1/1     1            1           16s
```

Once the deployment is completed, you can access the App in your browser, at [http://todo.local.gd:31338](http://todo.local.gd:31338).

```mdx-code-block
import PromiseRequested from "/img/docs/workshop/part-ii-promise-requested.png"
```

<figure className="diagram">
  <img className="large" src={PromiseRequested} alt="Clusters with a Promise
  installed" />

  <figcaption>Todo app getting deployed</figcaption>
</figure>

## Bonus Challenge

Kubernetes CRDs provide many features that you can use to make your Promise API more user-friendly. For example, you can set the `image` property to be required, ensure `service.port` is within a range of ports and set it to be `8080` by default. Try adding some of those validations to your Promise API. Check the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#validation) for reference. Once you add the validations, try sending invalid resource requests and see how Kubernetes responds.

## üéâ &nbsp; Congratulations!

You just now authored your first Promise and delivered an App-as-a-Service. Well done!

To recap what you achieved:

1. ‚úÖ&nbsp;&nbsp;`api`: Defined your Promise API as a Custom Resource Definition
1. ‚úÖ&nbsp;&nbsp;`dependencies`: Defined a Promise configure Workflow so dependencies are present on your Destinations to fulfil this Promise
1. ‚úÖ&nbsp;&nbsp;`workflows`: Built a simple pipeline step for Resource configuration
1. ‚úÖ&nbsp;&nbsp;Installed your Kratix Promise
1. ‚úÖ&nbsp;&nbsp;Created and submitted a request for the promised Resource

üëâüèæ&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, let's [go over promise workflows](./promise-workflows).
