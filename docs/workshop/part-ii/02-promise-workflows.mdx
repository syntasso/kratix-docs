In the previous tutorial, you wrote your first Promise, delivering Apps-as-a-service. In this section, you will dive deeper into Promise Workflows.

You will:

* [Learn about Promise Configure Workflows](#promise-workflows)

## Workflow design patterns {#workflows-design-patterns}

To recap, a [Kratix Promise](/main/reference/promises/intro) is configured with a collection of Workflows that can be triggered at different stages of the Promise or Resource lifecycle. In the previous section, you defined a Workflow for the `resource.configure` action. In that workflow, you defined a collection of Kubernetes Resources that needed to be created to fulfill the user's request.

However, there's virtually no limitation to what you can do in a Workflow. You can, for example, download software, run imperative commands, wait for manual approvals and more. Pipeline stages are meant to be reused across different Promises, so you can define a Workflow once and reuse it across multiple Promises.

To make that possible, it's important to follow some design patterns when writing Workflows. In this section, you will learn about some of these design patterns.

### Reusability

Workflows are a great place to validate and enforce common requirements. For example, if you write a stage that can check for necessary compliance requirements, that stage can be used by all applicable Pipelines. In addition, you can write stages to check for excess costs, labelling conventions, security risks, and more.

While most Workflows will have at least one stage with logic unique to that Promise, building the Kratix Pipeline stages with reusability in mind is a great way to make your platform extensible.

### Idempotency

An idempotent Workflow guarantees that running the same command multiple times will result in the same outcome. This is an important feature because they will be auto-reconciled on an ongoing basis.

Kubernetes controllers reconcile their objects in three scenarios:

- Object change
- Controller restart
- Default cadence

This means that yes, on every request for a Resource the Workflow will run. But also, it will run any time the controller is reset, as well as every 10 hours.

This means you will need to write your Workflows to make sure that rerunning them will not result in any adverse side effects. This is especially important when your workflow is interacting with external systems. In the next tutorials you will learn some strategies to make your Workflows idempotent.

  <summary>🤔 Wondering when to use Workflows versus creating a new Promise?</summary>

    Platform design requires thinking about how to divide platform offerings into right sized Promises and evaluating options for reusability and composability.

    Each Promise is a the encapsulation of something as-a-Service. But that doesn’t mean that all platform users will want or need all types of Promises. It can be extremely helpful to create lower level Promises for services that are composed into a number of higher level offerings. For example, a Kubernetes Promise may never be something requested by an application developer, but it may be that a number of software Promises like “environment”, or “data store” depend on a Kubernetes cluster that can be provisioned using a Promise.

    Promises are not the only way to create reusable components when designing your platform with Kratix. You can also create reusable Pipeline stages that can be run in a number of different Promise Workflows. For example, you may want to add default labels to certain types of resources. You can create a Pipeline stage which evaluates the resources set to be declared at the end of the Workflow and apply consistent labelling before writing.

    Since both Promises and Workflows can be reused, you may wonder when to use each. The best rule of thumb is to ask if you are describing a noun or a verb.

    Nouns are most easily described as _things_. A database is a thing, so is a cluster, or an application, or any number of software offerings your platform may support. If you are trying to provide some*thing* as-a-Service you should be thinking about creating a Promise.

    Verbs can be described as _actions_. Labelling, notifying, or scanning can all be actions you may want to take rather than things you want to create. These actions can often be made across multiple things, e.g. you may want to label both databases and queues. When you are trying to take action to fulfil a cross-cutting concern, this is most suited to a Workflow step.

    Like all rules of thumb, this should be treated as a guide. When it comes to system design it is important that it works for your context and the Syntasso team is happy to work with you as you approach these discussions as a team.

### Testability

One of the advantages of the Kratix workflow model is that it makes it easy to test your workflows. You can test your workflows in isolation, without having to deploy them to a cluster. This makes it easy to test your workflows as you are developing them.

The next section goes into more detail about how to test your workflows.

## Test driving your workflows {#test-driving-your-workflows}

In the previous tutorial you created a simple workflow that generated the Kubernetes resources needed to fulfill the user's request. You tested it by installing the Promise and then sending a resource request to the Platform.

A better way to test your workflows is to just execute the container in your local environment. It's relatively easy to do this, and it will save you a lot of time as you are developing your workflows.

### Prepare your environment

When Kratix starts your workflow, it will mount the following three volumes:

- `/kratix/input`: Kratix will add the user's request into this directory as `object.yaml`.
- `/kratix/output`: the files in this directory will be scheduled to a matching Destination.
- `/kratix/metadata`: a directory where you can write documents with special meaning to Kratix; you will cover this in the next tutorials.

That means that, to test it locally, you will need to provide the three volumes to your Docker command. Note that you will also need to write the `object.yaml` containing an example request in the `input` directory.

Still in the `app-promise` directory, run:

```bash
mkdir -p test/{input,output,metadata}
touch test/input/object.yaml
```

Later, when you run `docker run`, you will mount the three directories onto the container. But first, you need to create the `object.yaml` file in the `input` directory. Create a file called `test/input/object.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml title="app-promise/test/input/object.yaml"
apiVersion: workshop.kratix.io/v1
kind: App
metadata:
  name: my-app
  namespace: default
spec:
  image: example/image:v1.0.0
  service:
    port: 9000
```

With that in place, you can go ahead and test your pipeline! Since the next tutorials will ask you to rebuild and retest the image, it's a good idea to write a simple helper script that you can re-run in the future. Run the following:

```bash
mkdir -p scripts

cat << 'EOF' > scripts/build-pipeline
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -eu -o pipefail

testdir=$(cd "$(dirname "$0")"/../test; pwd)

docker build --tag kratix-workshop/app-pipeline-image:v1.0.0 workflows/resource/configure/mypipeline/kratix-workshop-app-pipeline-image
kind load docker-image kratix-workshop/app-pipeline-image:v1.0.0 --name platform
EOF

cat <<'EOF' > scripts/test-pipeline
#!/usr/bin/env bash

scriptsdir=$(cd "$(dirname "$0")"; pwd)
testdir=$(cd "$(dirname "$0")"/../test; pwd)
inputDir="$testdir/input"
outputDir="$testdir/output"
metadataDir="$testdir/metadata"

$scriptsdir/build-pipeline
rm -rf $outputDir/*

command=${1:-"resource-configure"}

docker run \
    --rm \
    --volume ~/.kube:/root/.kube \
    --network=host \
    --volume ${outputDir}:/kratix/output \
    --volume ${inputDir}:/kratix/input \
    --volume ${metadataDir}:/kratix/metadata \
    kratix-workshop/app-pipeline-image:v1.0.0 sh -c "$command"
EOF

chmod +x scripts/*
```

These scripts do the following:

- `build-pipeline` codifies the image building and loads the container image on the KinD cluster.
- `test-pipeline` calls build-pipeline and also runs the image, allowing you to verify the created files in the `test/output` directory.

At this stage, your directory structure should look like this:

```
📂 app-promise
├── README.md
├── dependencies
│   └── dependencies.yaml
├── example-resource.yaml
├── promise.yaml
├── scripts
│   ├── build-pipeline
│   └── test-pipeline
├── test
│   ├── input
│   │   └── object.yaml
│   ├── metadata
│   └── output
└── workflows
    └── resource
        └── configure
            └── mypipeline
                └── kratix-workshop-app-pipeline-image
                    ├── Dockerfile
                    ├── resources
                    └── scripts
                        └── resource-configure
```

### Run the tests

To execute the test, run the script with the following command:

```bash
./scripts/test-pipeline resource-configure
```

Which should build and run the image. Once the execution completes,
verify the `test/output` directory. You should see the following files:

```bash
📂 app-promise
├── ...
└── test
    ├── input
    │   └── object.yaml
    └── output
        ├── deployment.yaml
        ├── ingress.yaml
        └── service.yaml
```

You can take a look at the files and verify their contents. You can see where the user's inputs are being used, and how that is reflected in the created services. You can poke around and make changes to both the input and to the workflow, and see how the output reflects this.

The ability to treat images as independent pieces of software that can
have their own development lifecycle (fully testable, easy to execute locally,
release independent) allows platform teams to move faster, sharing and reusing
images across their Promises.

## Promise workflows {#promise-workflows}

As previously mentioned, you can define workflows to be executed at different stages of the lifecycle of a Promise or of a Resource. In this section, you will learn how to define workflows that will be executed when a Promise is installed.

Promise workflows are useful when you want to take actions that are not directly related to the creation of a Resource. For example, you may want to create an account on a third-party service, or send a notification to a Slack channel, when a promise is installed.

You can also declare all of your Promise dependencies inside a Promise workflow. This helps you keep your Promise definition clean and focused on the user's request.

### Create a Promise workflow

A Promise Workflow is no different from a Resource Workflow. The only differences are:

* In a Promise workflow, `/kratix/input/object.yaml` will contain the Promise definition, instead of a Resource definition.
* At the end of the workflow, any documents in `/kratix/output` will be scheduled to _all_ Destinations, instead of just one.

Although you can do any setup you need or want in the Promise Workflow, declaring the Promise Dependencies is one of its most common uses. For that reason, you can once again rely on the Kratix CLI to create the Promise Workflow for you.

Run the following command:

```bash
kratix update dependencies ./dependencies/ --image kratix-workshop/app-promise-pipeline:v0.1.0
```

At this stage, your directory structure should look like this:

```
📂 app-promise
├── README.md
├── dependencies
│   └── dependencies.yaml
├── example-resource.yaml
├── promise.yaml
├── scripts
│   └── ...
├── test
│   └── ...
└── workflows
    ├── promise
    │   └── configure
    │       └── dependencies
    │           └── configure-deps
    │               ├── Dockerfile
    │               ├── resources
    │               │   └── dependencies.yaml
    │               └── scripts
    │                   └── pipeline.sh
    └── resource
        └── configure
            └── mypipeline
                └── kratix-workshop-app-pipeline-image
                    └── ...
```

The pipeline script generated by the CLI is already set up to deploy the dependencies into the Destinations. Check the `pipeline.sh` script for details.

### Test the Promise workflow

Before running the tests, update the `scripts/build-pipeline` script to also build and load the Promise workflow image:

```bash
cat <<EOF >> scripts/build-pipeline
docker build --tag kratix-workshop/app-promise-pipeline:v0.1.0 workflows/promise/configure/dependencies/configure-deps
kind load docker-image kratix-workshop/app-promise-pipeline:v0.1.0 --name platform
EOF
```

Next, execute the script to build and load the image:

```bash
./scripts/build-pipeline
```

Similar to the resource workflow, you can test the Promise workflow with Docker. Feel free to create a script to help you with this (similar to the one you created for the resource workflow) or to run the commands manually. Run:

```bash
rm -rf test/output/*
docker run \
    --rm \
    --volume ~/.kube:/root/.kube \
    --network=host \
    --volume ./test/output:/kratix/output \
    --volume ./test/input:/kratix/input \
    --volume ./test/metadata:/kratix/metadata \
    kratix-workshop/app-promise-pipeline:v0.1.0
```

This will build the image, run it, and verify the output. You should see a single file, `dependencies.yaml`, in the `test/output` directory, with the contents of the dependencies you defined.

### Add the workflow to the Promise

The CLI already updated your Promise file with the Promise workflow.

Inspect it by running:

```bash
cat promise.yaml | yq '.spec.workflows'
```

Note how there are two `workflows` being defined now: `resource` and `promise`. The `resource` workflow will be executed when a Resource is reconciled, and the `promise` workflow will be executed when a Promise is reconciled. You can also add `resource.delete` and `promise.delete` workflows, but those are out of the scope of this tutorial.

### Update the Promise

You can now update the Promise on the Platform cluster:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM apply --filename promise.yaml
```

Kratix will automatically detect the changes and will execute the newly defined `promise.configure` workflow. You can verify this by checking that there is now a pod running on the `kratix-platform-system`:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM get pods --namespace kratix-platform-system
```

This pod can run to completion quite quickly so when you verify that it exists, it might already be in a `Completed` state. This reflects that the `promise.configure` workflow has finished running.

```shell-session
NAME                                   READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
kratix-app-dependencies-20073-6phwj    0/1     Completed   0          19s
```

When the `Status` is `Completed`, it means that the workflow has finished running. Check the worker, and verify that the NGINX Ingress Controller is running:

```bash
kubectl --context $WORKER get deployments --namespace ingress-nginx
```

:::note

It may briefly disappear and reappear as the worker reconciles the state of the cluster. This is normal behavior.

:::

The combination of the workflows Kratix provides is very powerful. It enables platform teams to define complex workflows that can be executed at different stages of the lifecycle of a Resource or a Promise.
