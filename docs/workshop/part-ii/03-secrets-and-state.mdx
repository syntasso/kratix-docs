In the previous tutorial, you learned about the different lifecycle hooks you can define in your Promise workflows. In this section, you will go over some basic use-cases, like accessing Secrets, from within your Promise workflows.

You will:

* [Learn how to access secrets in your Pipeline](#secrets)
* [Learn how to store and reuse state between runs](#state)

To illustrate the concepts above, you will be updating your Promise so that it creates a bucket in the MinIO server that's deployed in your Platform cluster. You will create the bucket using `terraform`.

## Secrets

A common need for Workflows is to access secrets. In your Promise, you will need access to the MinIO credentials to be able to create a bucket. You could pull the credentials in different ways, but the Kratix Pipeline kind provides a convenient way to access secrets, similar to how you would access Secrets in a Kubernetes Pod.

To start, create a new `Secret` in your Platform cluster:

```yaml
cat <<EOF | kubectl --context $PLATFORM apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: app-promise-minio-creds
  namespace: default
type: Opaque
stringData:
  username: minioadmin
  password: minioadmin
  endpoint: minio.kratix-platform-system.svc.cluster.local
EOF
```

Next edit your Promise with the new `create-bucket` step. From within this step, you will load the secret defined above as an environment variable. Please copy only the highlighted block to your existing Promise definition:

```yaml title="app-promise/promise.yaml"
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: Promise
metadata:
  name: app
spec:
  api: #... abbreviated
  workflows:
    promise: #... abbreviated
    resource:
      configure:
        - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
          kind: Pipeline
          metadata:
            name: mypipeline
          spec:
            containers:
              - image: kratix-workshop/app-pipeline-image:v1.0.0
                name: kratix-workshop-app-pipeline-image
                command: [ resource-configure ]
          #highlight-start
              - name: create-bucket
                image: kratix-workshop/app-pipeline-image:v1.0.0
                command: [ create-bucket ]
                env:
                  - name: MINIO_ENDPOINT
                    valueFrom:
                      secretKeyRef:
                        name: app-promise-minio-creds
                        key: endpoint
                  - name: MINIO_USER
                    valueFrom:
                      secretKeyRef:
                        name: app-promise-minio-creds
                        key: username
                  - name: MINIO_PASSWORD
                    valueFrom:
                      secretKeyRef:
                        name: app-promise-minio-creds
                        key: password
          #highlight-end
status: {}
```

You can now add the `create-bucket` script to your Resource Worfklow Pipeline image. Create a `create-bucket` script in the `workflows/resource/configure/mypipeline/kratix-workshop-app-pipeline-image/scripts/` directory:

```bash
touch ./workflows/resource/configure/mypipeline/kratix-workshop-app-pipeline-image/scripts/create-bucket
touch ./workflows/resource/configure/mypipeline/kratix-workshop-app-pipeline-image/resources/terraform.tf
```

Next, create the terraform script that will be executed by the `create-bucket` script:

```mdx-code-block
import Terraform from '!!raw-loader!./_partials/secrets-and-state/01-terraform.tf';
```

<CodeBlock language="terraform" title="app-promise/workflows/resource/configure/mypipeline/kratix-workshop-app-pipeline-image/resources/terraform.tf">
    {Terraform}
</CodeBlock>

Update your `Dockerfile` to include `curl` and install the Terraform CLI:

```dockerfile title="app-promise/workflows/resource/configure/mypipeline/kratix-workshop-app-pipeline-image/Dockerfile"
FROM "alpine"

#highlight-start
RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache yq kubectl curl
RUN curl https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.7.1/terraform_1.7.1_linux_amd64.zip -o terraform.zip && \
   unzip terraform.zip && \
   mv terraform /usr/local/bin/terraform && \
   rm terraform.zip
#highlight-end

COPY scripts/* /usr/bin/
ADD resources resources

RUN chmod +x /usr/bin/*

# Fix for when running workshop on Windows machine
RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache dos2unix
RUN dos2unix /usr/bin/*

ENTRYPOINT []
```

Finally, create the `create-bucket` script:

```mdx-code-block
import CreateBucket from '!!raw-loader!./_partials/secrets-and-state/02-create-bucket.sh';
```

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="app-promise/workflows/resource/configure/mypipeline/kratix-workshop-app-pipeline-image/scripts/create-bucket">
    {CreateBucket}
</CodeBlock>

With all of that in place, you can test the Workflow. Before running running the test, ensure kubectl is pointing to the platform cluster before running the test script:

```bash
kubectl config set current-context $PLATFORM
```

With that change in place, you can run the test script:

```bash
./scripts/test-pipeline create-bucket
```

If everything works well, you should see a new bucket created in your MinIO server:

```bash
mc ls kind/
```

The output should look like this:

```shell-session
[2024-01-26 15:33:03 GMT]     0B kratix/
[2024-01-31 11:44:55 GMT]     0B my-app.default/
```

Great! That proves our pipeline stage works end-to-end. But what happens if you try to re-run the tests?

```bash
./scripts/test-pipeline create-bucket
```

You should see the following error:

```shell-session
minio_s3_bucket.state_terraform_s3: Creating...
╷
│ Error: [FATAL] bucket already exists! (my-app.default): <nil>
│
│   with minio_s3_bucket.state_terraform_s3,
│   on terraform.tf line 14, in resource "minio_s3_bucket" "state_terraform_s3":
│   14: resource "minio_s3_bucket" "state_terraform_s3" {
```


The `create-bucket` step is not idempotent. That means that, when Kratix tries to reconcile the resource again, it will fail because the bucket already exists.

To make it idempotent, you need to store and retrieve the terraform state from the previous run, and use it if it already exists. Hop on to the next section to learn how to do that.

## State

There are many ways to store and retrieve state from within a pipeline. You could, for example, push the resulting state to a remote repository, rely on third-party services like Terraform Cloud, or use Kubernetes resources like ConfigMaps. For simplicity, we will use ConfigMaps to store and retrieve the state.

To store the terraform state in a ConfigMap, the first step is to give the Kratix Pipeline Service Account the ability to create and retrieve ConfigMaps. There are a few ways
that you can ensure the Kratix Pipeline Service Account has the appropriate permissions to access resources, on this occasion we are going to specify the additional permissions required by the Workflow via the `spec.rbac.permissions` in the Pipeline specification.

In your `promise.yaml`, find the Workflow for the `resource.configure` Pipeline. Edit the Workflow's Pipeline `spec` to have the following:

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: Promise
metadata:
  name: app
spec:
  api: #... abbreviated
  workflows:
    promise: #... abbreviated
    resource:
      configure:
        - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
          kind: Pipeline
          metadata:
            name: mypipeline
          spec:
            # Ensure your adding this to the Resource workflow, *NOT* the
            # Promise workflow
            #highlight-start
            rbac:
              permissions:
                - apiGroups: [""]
                  verbs: ["*"]
                  resources: ["configmaps"]
                  #highlight-end
            containers: #...
          # rest of the file
```

This updates the permissions of the Kratix Pipeline Service Account to allow it to create and retrieve ConfigMaps. You can read more about how to configure RBAC permission in Pipelines in the [Kratix reference documentation](/main/reference/workflows#rbac).

Next, you need to update the `create-bucket` script to both store the state and retrieve any existing state. Open the `create-bucket` script and update it to look like this:

```mdx-code-block
import CreateBucketWithState from '!!raw-loader!./_partials/secrets-and-state/03-create-bucket-with-state.sh';
```

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="app-promise/workflows/resource/configure/mypipeline/kratix-workshop-app-pipeline-image/scripts/create-bucket">
    {CreateBucketWithState}
</CodeBlock>


Before re-running the test, make sure to delete the previous buckets, since the `create-bucket` script will try to create a bucket with the same name:

```bash
mc rb kind/my-app.default
```

Now you can run the test script again:

```bash
./scripts/test-pipeline create-bucket
```

You should see from the logs that the bucket got created and that the state got persisted in a ConfigMap. You can validate with the following command:

```bash
mc ls kind/
```

The above command should show you the buckets, like last time:

```shell-session
[2024-01-26 15:33:03 GMT]     0B kratix/
[2024-01-31 11:44:55 GMT]     0B my-app.default/
```

As for the ConfigMap, you can retrieve it with the following command:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM get configmap my-app-state --output=jsonpath={.data.tfstate}
```

The output should look like this:

```json
{
    "version": "4",
    ...
}
```

Excellent. Now try re-running the test script:

```bash
./scripts/test-pipeline create-bucket
```

This time it should just work! You can see from the logs (snippet below) that the state got retrieved from the ConfigMap and that no changes were applied. The test log should include the following lines:

```shell-session
minio_s3_bucket.state_terraform_s3: Refreshing state... [id=my-app.default]

No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

Terraform has compared your real infrastructure against your configuration
and found no differences, so no changes are needed.

Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

Awesome! You pipeline stage is now idempotent, so go ahead and apply the promise with the new stage into your Platform:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM apply --filename promise.yaml
```

<details>
<summary>

_Click here_ for the full `promise.yaml` file.

</summary>

```mdx-code-block
import FullPromise from "!!raw-loader!./_partials/secrets-and-state/04-full-promise.yaml"
```

<CodeBlock language="yaml" title="app-promise/promise.yaml">
  {FullPromise}
</CodeBlock>

</details>

As soon as the Promise is applied, Kratix will trigger an update for the existing application. Once the pipeline completes, you should see a new Bucket on your MinIO server:

```bash
mc ls kind/
```

The output should look like this:

```shell-session
[2024-01-26 15:33:03 GMT]     0B kratix/
[2024-01-31 11:44:55 GMT]     0B my-app.default/
[2024-01-31 11:44:55 GMT]     0B todo.default/
```

You should also see the ConfigMap for the todo app:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM get configmap todo-state --output=jsonpath={.data.tfstate}
```

The output should look like this:

```json
{
    "version": "4",
    ...
}
```

To validate the idempotency, you can force the resource to reconcile by setting the `kratix.io/manual-reconciliation` label to true. Kratix listens to that label and, when it detects it, forces a reconciliation for the resource. Trigger a reconciliation:

```bash
# trigger the reconciliation
kubectl --context $PLATFORM label apps.workshop.kratix.io todo kratix.io/manual-reconciliation=true
```

Once the pipeline completes, you can check the logs and verify how it reused the state from the ConfigMap:

```bash
pod_name=$(kubectl --context $PLATFORM get pods --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp -o jsonpath="{.items[-1:].metadata.name}")
kubectl --context $PLATFORM logs $pod_name --container create-bucket
```

If you trigger the reconciliation again, you should see the Pipeline logs indicating that no changes were applied, just as you observed in the test.

## Bonus Challenge

You may have noticed that, at this stage, the bucket the Pipeline is created won't be removed when the user deletes their App request. As an extra challenge, try to implement a delete lifecycle hook for your resource, that deletes the bucket. Take a look at the [Workflow reference docs](/main/reference/workflows) to find out more (tip: check the `workflows.resource.delete` property).
