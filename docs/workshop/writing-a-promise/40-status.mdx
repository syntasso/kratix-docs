In the previous tutorial, you learned how to access secrets and states from a
Pipeline. In this section, you will learn how to surface information to users
via the status of a Resource.

You will:

* [Learn about the Metadata directory in Kratix Workflows](#metadata)
* [Learn how to expose information via the Resource Status](#status)

## Conveying information back to the application developers {#metadata}

What we've focused on so far is how to define a Kratix Promise in a compelling
way so that platform users choose to use the platform. A Kratix-powered platform
enables users to ask for the services they need, on-demand, without having to
know unnecessary business and service lifecycle requirements.

What platform users need, though, is the end-to-end experience of making a 
imple request, understanding what's happening with the request, then ultimately
making use of the service created by the request. So how do you communicate
information about a request back to platform users, and how do users use the
services that the platform creates?

There are actually a number of ways you can communicate the status of a service
to the platform, and the choice comes down to the Promise and Promise Workflow
author.

One approach is to generate notifications for internal systems like Slack or
Teams from the Promise Workflow's Pipeline container.

Another approach, which is what we'll choose today, is to follow convention and
leverage the `status` field on Kubernetes resources. The Kratix Workflow's
Pipeline has the ability to write information back to the status of the
Resource.

In the context of your Promise, an example of what you might want to convey back
is the configuration of the Resource (e.g. default configuration), and how to
access the running Resources (e.g. a URL or connection string).

## Status

As we saw in [Promise Workflows](./promise-workflows), within the Pipeline
container file system, Kratix mounts a [`/kratix/metadata`](/main/reference/workflows#metadata)
directory to manage important configuration that is independent of the Resources
definitions for your State Store.

In this section, you will focus on one of the files in the `metadata` directory:
`status.yaml`.

The `status.yaml` file can contain arbitrary key-value pairs. Anything you write
in this file will be persistent in the resource, and visible when the user inspects it.

The `message` key is a special key that is displayed as part of the `kubectl get resource`
command.

With that in-mind, you can update your existing `resource-configure` script to
surface some information about the Resource in the `status.yaml` file. One of
the things you may want to surface is, for example, the URL of the running
application.

Add the following lines to the end of your `resource-configure` script:

```bash title="app-promise/workflows/resource/configure/mypipeline/kratix-workshop-app-pipeline-image/scripts/resource-configure

# Set the resource status
cat <<EOF > /kratix/metadata/status.yaml
message: "${name}.local.gd:31338"
EOF
```

Next, run the tests:

```bash
./scripts/test-pipeline resource-configure
```

You should see the following in your local directory:

```
📁 app-promise
...
└── test
    ├── input
    │   └── object.yaml
    ├── metadata
    │   └── status.yaml
    └── output
        ├── deployment.yaml
        ├── ingress.yaml
        └── service.yaml
 ```

If you inspect the `test/metadata/status.yaml` file, you should see something
like the following:

```yaml
message: "my-app.local.gd:31338"
```

Excellent. With that file in place, Kratix will automatically persist that
information to the status of the Resource.

The status that persist to your resource will also be viewable the next time
the pipeline runs by inspecting the `/kratix/input/object.yaml`. For example
after the very first pipeline has run, all future pipelines would have an input
object like the following:

```yaml title="test/input/object.yaml"
apiVersion: workshop.kratix.io/v1
kind: App
metadata:
  name: my-app
  namespace: default
spec:
  image: example/image:v1.0.0
  service:
    port: 9000
status:
  message: "my-app.local.gd:31338"
```

Great! Now you have a way to persist information about your Resource.

This time, you haven't changed the Promise at all, but rather updated the
underlying pipeline image. The existing resources will automatically get the new
status information on the next reconciliation.

Just like last time, you can force a reconciliation by adding the `kratix.io/manual-reconciliation = true`
label:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM label apps.workshop.kratix.io todo kratix.io/manual-reconciliation=true
```

Once the pipeline completes, you should see the new status information on the
Resource:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM describe apps.workshop.kratix.io todo
```

The above command outputs something similar to the following:

```yaml
Name:         todo
Namespace:    default
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  <none>

```

Note how the `status` field is now populated with the information you added to
the `status.yaml` file.

:::info

You may also notice that there's a condition called `ConfigureWorkflowCompleted`.
This is a special condition that is automatically added to the status of the
Resource, and set to `True` when all Pipelines in the Configure workflow have
completed successfully.

:::

Furthermore, the value for the `message` key should also be displayed as part of
the `get` command:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM get apps.workshop.kratix.io
```

The above command should output the following:

```shell-session
NAME   MESSAGE               STATUS
todo   todo.local.gd:31338   Reconciled
```

## Bonus Challenge

We just learned how to persist information about your Resource via using Status.
As a bonus challenge, let's take a look at how to ensure that the information in
Status is not overwritten if it already exists.

:::note

Kubernetes automatically adds a `metadata.creationTimestamp` field to all
resources. The date you will add to the status is only to illustrate how to add
dynamic information to the status.

:::

Update your `resource-configure` script so it sets a new field `createdAt`:

```bash title="app-promise/workflows/resource/configure/mypipeline/kratix-workshop-app-pipeline-image/scripts/resource-configure
createdAt="$(date)"

# Set the resource status
cat <<EOF > /kratix/metadata/status.yaml
createdAt: ${createdAt}
message: "${name}.local.gd:31338"
EOF
```

Next, run the tests:

```bash
./scripts/test-pipeline resource-configure
```

If you inspect the `test/metadata/status.yaml` file, you should see that there
is a new field `createdAt` added:

```yaml
createdAt: "Wed Jan 1 15:00:00 UTC 2023"
message: "my-app.local.gd:31338"
```

If you run the pipeline again, you will see that the `createdAt` field is
updated to the current date. This is because our pipeline is not idempotent. You
can fix this by checking the status on the resource, and only updating the
status if it is not already set.

Update your `workflow/resource-configure` script to the following:

```bash title="app-promise/workflows/resource/configure/mypipeline/kratix-workshop-app-pipeline-image/scripts/resource-configure"
#highlight-start
createdAt=$(yq '.status.createdAt // ""' /kratix/input/object.yaml)
if [ -z "$createdAt" ]; then
  createdAt="$(date)"
fi
#highlight-end

# Set the resource status
cat <<EOF > /kratix/metadata/status.yaml
createdAt: "${createdAt}"
message: "${name}.local.gd:31338"
EOF
```

Now test your changes:

```bash
./scripts/test-pipeline resource-configure
```

Inspect the `test/metadata/status.yaml` file. Since your input does not contain
the `status` field, you should see today's date in the `createdAt` field. Now,
to test that the status is not updated if it already exists, change your test
input to look like the following:

```yaml title="test/input/object.yaml"
apiVersion: workshop.kratix.io/v1
kind: App
metadata:
  name: my-app
  namespace: default
spec:
  image: example/image:v1.0.0
  service:
    port: 9000
status:
  createdAt: "Thu Jan 28 15:00:00 UTC 2021"
  message: "my-app.local.gd:31338"
```

Re-run the tests:

```bash
./scripts/test-pipeline resource-configure
```

If you inspect the `test/metadata/status.yaml` file now, you should see the
following:

```yaml
createdAt: "Thu Jan 28 15:00:00 UTC 2021"
message: "my-app.local.gd:31338"
```

Awesome! You now have a way to ensure that the information is not overwritten if
it already exists.

Let's force a reconciliation by adding the `kratix.io/manual-reconciliation = true`
label:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM label apps.workshop.kratix.io todo kratix.io/manual-reconciliation=true
```

Once the pipeline completes, you should see the new status information on the
Resource:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM describe apps.workshop.kratix.io todo
```

The above command outputs something similar to the following:

```yaml
Name:         todo
Namespace:    default
API Version:  workshop.kratix.io/v1
Kind:         App
Metadata:
  Creation Timestamp:  2024-01-31T15:27:43Z
...
Spec:
  Image:  syntasso/sample-todo:v0.1.0
  Service:
    Port:  8080
Status:
...
  #highlight-start
  Created At:              Wed Jan 1 15:01:01 UTC 2023
  #highlight-end
  Message:                 todo.local.gd:31338
Events:                    <none>
```

Note how the `status` field is now populated with the information you added to
the `status.yaml` file.

Try retriggering the reconciliation by adding the label again. You should notice
that the `CreatedAt` field is not updated, just like you observed in the test.
