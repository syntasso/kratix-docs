## Install cli tools

In our workshops, you will run Kratix on a local Kubernetes cluster, and deploy
Kratix workloads on another Kubernetes cluster. You will need the following
tools:

1. `kratix` CLI / **Kratix Command-line Tool**: <br />
   Used to build the Promise in the [Writing a Promise Workshop](../writing-a-promise/intro). <br />
   See [Kratix CLI documentation page](/main/kratix-cli/intro)
   for installation instructions.

1. `kind` CLI / **Kubernetes-in-Docker (KinD)**: <br />
   Used to create and manage local Kubernetes clusters in Docker. <br />
   See [the quick start guide](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) to install.

1. `docker` CLI / **Docker**: <br /> Used to orchestrate containers. `kind`
   requires that you have Docker installed and configured. <br /> See [Get
   Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install.

1. `kubectl` / **Kubernetes command-line tool**: <br /> The CLI for
   Kubernetes&mdash;allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. <br
   /> See [the install guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl).

1. `yq` / **YAML parsing command-line tool**: <br /> The CLI for
   Kubernetes&mdash;allows you to run parse and transform YAML files. This is only used in Part II. <br
   /> See [the install guide](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq#install).

   :::warning

   There are a few different versions of `yq` available. A few package managers
   will install a Python version of `yq` which is not compatible with the
   Workshop. Make sure to install the Go version of `yq`, as linked above.

   :::

1. `mc` / **MinIO Client**: <br /> The CLI for MinIO&mdash;allows you to run commands against MinIO clusters. <br
   /> See [the install guide](https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/).

1. `git` / **Git**: <br /> The CLI for Git&mdash;allows you to clone the Kratix repository. <br
   /> See [the install guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

:::info

You can run the workshop without `kind`. Ideally in this case, you will have access to two
Kubernetes clusters.

One cluster will be the **Platform** cluster, where Kratix will be installed.
Whenever you see `--context kind-platform`, replace it with the context of your
platform cluster.

The other worker will be the **Worker** cluster. Whenever you see `--context
kind-worker`, replace it with the context of your worker cluster.

If you want to try it on a single cluster, you can omit the `--context` flag and
argument entirely.

## Docker Resources

In order to complete all tutorials in this series, you must allocate enough
resources to Docker. Ensure you allocate at least:

- 5 CPU
- 12GB Memory
- 4GB swap

This can be managed through your tool of choice (e.g. Docker Desktop, Rancher, etc).

You are now ready to [create the clusters](./create-clusters) for the workshop!
