## What's a Compound Promise? {#what-is-a-compound-promise}

Imagine that you want to provide your users with a simpler way to deploy their
applications. You do your research and notice that most teams use a similar
stack: PostgreSQL as database, Redis for caching, Grafana for monitoring, etc.
You also find out that the majority of users don't care about a lot of the
configuration options of those services, as long as they come with sane
defaults.

However, not all teams are created equal. Some teams need specific versions of
those services, configured with specific parameters, on specific regions and
resources.

You want the platform to cater for both: it should be simple to get the simple
services and it should be possible to get the specialised ones. You decide to
provide each of the individual services as a Promise. Specialist teams can then
use the API to get the exact service they need.

To deliver the simpler experience though, you want to orchestrate those Promises
in a higher-level Promise. In Kratix terms, this is a Compound Promise: a
Promise that defines other Promises as its Dependencies.

In this tutorial, you will install and use a Compound Promise.

## Installing a Compound Promise {#write-a-compound-promise}

The Compound Promise you will install can be found on the Kratix repository,
under `samples/easy-app`. This Compound Promise encapsulate the Nginx
and the Postgres Promises.

Compound Promises work by including, in their list of Dependencies, other
Promises. Those Promises need to be scheduled to the platform cluster itself.
That means you will need to include the platform cluster to the list of clusters
where workloads can be scheduled to.

### Validate the state of your platform cluster

Before jumping in, verify that Kratix is still up and running on your platform cluster:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM get pods --namespace kratix-platform-system
```

The above command will give an output similar to:
```shell-session
NAME                                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kratix-platform-controller-manager-7cc49f598b-zqkmz   2/2     Running   0          4h4m
minio-6f75d9fbcf-jpstv                                1/1     Running   0          4h4m
```

If the command above display a different output, please refer back to previous
guides.


### Register the platform as a Destination

To register the platform cluster as an available Destination, you will run
through the same steps you ran during the worker cluster Destination registration in
[Installing a Promise](installing-a-promise):

* Install and configure Flux
* Register the cluster as a Destination with Kratix

There's a script in the `kratix` directory that will do exactly that. This script replicates the setup you performed previously in the [Destination setup](./installing-kratix#destination-setup) section. Run:

```bash
./scripts/register-destination --name platform-cluster --context $PLATFORM --state-store default --strict-match-labels
```

The platform cluster should now be registered with Kratix and ready to receive
the workloads. Verify:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM get destinations
```

The above command will give an output similar to:
```shell-session
NAME               AGE
platform-cluster    1m
worker-cluster      1h
```

Similar to when you registered the worker cluster, you should also see a `kratix-worker-system` namespace, indicating that Flux is correctly configured. Verify:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM get namespaces --watch
```

The above command will give an output similar to:
```shell-session
NAME                     STATUS   AGE
...
kratix-platform-system   Active    1h
//highlight-next-line
kratix-worker-system     Active    1m
...
```

Once you see `kratix-worker-system` on the output,
press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to exit the watch mode.

You are now ready to install the EasyApp Promise.

### Install the Promise


Since the EasyApp Promise declares two other Promises as its Dependencies,
installing it will add a total of three Promises to the platform:

* The EasyApp Promise itself
* The EasyApp Promise dependencies: NGINX and PostgreSQL

<figure className="diagram">
  <PavedPathDiagram className="small"/>

  <figcaption>EasyApp Promise</figcaption>
</figure>

From the Kratix directory, install the EasyApp Promise:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM apply --filename samples/easy-app/promise.yaml
```

Validate the EasyApp promises are successfully installed:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM get promises --watch
```

The above command will eventually include the following output:

```shell-session
easyapp   Available     EasyApp   example.promise.syntasso.io/v1
```

Once you see the "Available", press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to
exit the watch mode.

At this point, you may be asking yourself: _"Wait, wasn't the EasyApp Promise supposed to install three Promises? Why is there only one?"_

That's because the EasyApp Promise makes use of the Kratix _Destination Selectors_ feature.

Destination Selectors allow Promises to specify scheduling logic to determine the suitable Destinations for hosting Dependencies and workloads.

You can verify the EasyApp Destination Selector by describing the Promise:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM describe promise easyapp | tail -n 30 | \
  grep "Destination Selectors" --after-context 2 --max-count 1
```

The above command will give an output similar to:
```shell-session
Destination Selectors:
  Match Labels:
    Environment: platform
```

This means the EasyApp Promise is telling Kratix:

> Only install my Dependencies (i.e., the NGINX and the PostgreSQL Promises) in
> Destinations with the **label environment=platform**.

Check the registered Destinations again, but this time ask `kubectl` to also show the Destination labels:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM get destinations --show-labels
```

The above command will give an output similar to:
```shell-session
NAME               AGE   LABELS
platform-cluster   10m   <none>
worker-cluster      1h   environment=dev
```

<figure className="diagram">
  <InstallErrorDiagram className="large"/>

</figure>

Note that the platform cluster is missing the required label. Adding the missing
label should cause the system to converge to the desired state:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM label destination platform-cluster environment=platform; \
kubectl --context $PLATFORM get promises --watch
```

The above command will eventually converge to an output similar to:
```shell-session
NAME            STATUS      KIND         API VERSION                      VERSION
easyapp         Available   EasyApp      example.promise.syntasso.io/v1
nginx-ingress   Available   deployment   marketplace.kratix.io/v1alpha1
postgresql      Available   postgresql   marketplace.kratix.io/v1alpha1
```

Once you see the expected three Promises, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to
exit the watch mode.

<figure className="diagram">
  <InstallationPlatformDiagram/>
  <figcaption>Sequence of events during the installation of a Compound Promise</figcaption>
</figure>

Once the sub-Promises are installed, their Dependencies will be scheduled to a
Destination. The EasyApp sub-Promises are also declaring a Destination Selector.
Verify:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM describe promise nginx-ingress |  grep "Destination Selectors:" -A 2 -m 1
kubectl --context $PLATFORM describe promise postgresql | grep "Destination Selectors:" -A 2 -m 1
```

The above command will give an output similar to:
```shell-session
Destination Selectors:
  Match Labels:
    Environment: dev
```

The NGINX and the PostgreSQL Promises are telling Kratix:

> Only install my Dependencies (which include, the NGINX Ingress Controller and the
> PostgreSQL operator) in Destinations with the **label environment=dev**.

As you may have noted before, the worker cluster is already labelled correctly.
Verify:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM get destination worker-cluster --show-labels
```

The above command will give an output similar to:
```shell-session
NAME               AGE   LABELS
worker-cluster      1h   environment=dev
```

Since the worker Destination include the label, the NGINX and PostgreSQL Promise
Dependencies should be getting installed into the worker cluster. Verify:

```bash
kubectl --context $WORKER get deployments --watch
```

The above command will give an output similar to (it may take a few minutes for
it to appear and to start):

```shell-session
NAME                  READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-nginx-ingress   1/1     1            1           1m
postgres-operator     1/1     1            1           1m
```

When the deployments eventually complete, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to
exit.

Platform users can go ahead and start using the Promises!

:::info Managing a Fleet of Destinations

The mechanism described above is one of the most powerful features in Kratix:
the ability platform teams have to fully control the scheduling of works across
Destinations.

When a Destination is registered, Kratix will use the destination selectors to
determine what should be immediately installed on the new Destination. When a
Promise gets updated or upgraded, its Dependencies are seamlessly propagated
across the fleet. If a Destination labels change, Kratix will automatically converge on the expected system state.

If you are curious to learn more about Kratix scheduling, check the
[Multi-cluster Management](../main/reference/destinations/multidestination-management) docs.

## Request an EasyApp

As a platform user, you now have a few choices of Promises. Verify the available
Promises:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM get promises
```

The above command will give an output similar to:
```shell-session
NAME            STATUS      KIND         API VERSION                      VERSION
easyapp         Available   EasyApp      example.promise.syntasso.io/v1
nginx-ingress   Available   deployment   marketplace.kratix.io/v1alpha1
postgresql      Available   postgresql   marketplace.kratix.io/v1alpha1
```

You could request each one of those services individually if you needed
fine-grained control of how they ought to be deployed, or you can use the
EasyApp Promise to get an opinionated deployment of each of those. In this
example, all you want is to run your application without much fuss.

Create a request for a new EasyApp Resource:

```yaml
cat <<EOF | kubectl --context $PLATFORM apply --filename -
---
apiVersion: example.promise.syntasso.io/v1
kind: EasyApp
metadata:
  name: example
  namespace: default
spec:
  name: todo
  image: syntasso/sample-todo-app:v0.1.2
  dbDriver: postgres
EOF
```

The above command will give an output similar to:
```shell-session
easyapp.example.promise.syntasso.io/example created
```

The EasyApp Promise will take that request and generate the necessary
requests for the sub-Promises, wiring up the application to the Postgres
service.

  <PipelineDiagram className="large"/>

  <figcaption>EasyApp Workflow execution; NGINX omitted from brevity</figcaption>
</figure>

Verify the Workflows running on the platform cluster:


```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM get pods --watch
```

The above command will give an output similar to:
```shell-session
NAME                                                       READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
kratix-easyapp-example-instance-configure-43a5e-x7sdg      0/1     Completed   0          45s
kratix-nginx-ingress-todo-instance-configure-0907d-8zs5m   0/1     Completed   0          13s
kratix-postgresql-todo-instance-configure-6b25f-chtj6      0/1     Completed   0          13s
```

Once the Status column reports `Completed` for all three request pipelines,
press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to exit the watch mode. It may take a few
seconds for the Postgres and Nginx pipelines to start.

Similar to last time, Kratix will store the Pipeline outputs (i.e. the desired
state) in the State Store for the worker cluster, and that will be picked up by
the GitOps toolkit running on the worker.

Verify that the requested pods start on the worker cluster (it may take a few
minutes):

```bash
kubectl --context $WORKER get pods --watch
```

The above command will give an output similar to:
```shell-session
NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
#highlight-next-line
acid-todo-postgresql-0                 1/1     Running   0          110s
nginx-nginx-ingress-58c4dcb47d-49fd8   1/1     Running   0          10m
postgres-operator-79754946d-nmkhr      1/1     Running   0          10m
#highlight-next-line
todo-84f6b6698-vqxqm                   1/1     Running   0          74s
```

Once you see the `todo` and the `acid-todo-postgresql-0` pods reporting `Ready
1/1`, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to exit the watch mode.

The app is now fully deployed! You can now access it on
[http://todo.local.gd:31338/](http://todo.local.gd:31338/).

## Clean up

Delete the EasyApp Promise:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM delete promise easyapp
```

The above command will give an output similar to:

```shell-session
promise.platform.kratix.io "easyapp" deleted
```
