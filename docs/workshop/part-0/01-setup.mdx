title: "Installing the tools"
description: Find out what you need in installed before starting the workshop
---

In this workshop, you will deploy Kratix on a local Kubernetes cluster, and deploy
Kratix workloads on another Kubernetes cluster. You will need the following
tools:

1. `kind` CLI / **Kubernetes-in-Docker (KinD)**: <br />
  Used to create and manage local Kubernetes clusters in Docker. <br />
  See [the quick start guide](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) to install.

1. `docker` CLI / **Docker**: <br /> Used to orchestrate containers. `kind`
   requires that you have Docker installed and configured. <br /> See [Get
   Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install.

1. `kubectl` / **Kubernetes command-line tool**: <br /> The CLI for
   Kubernetes&mdash;allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. <br
   /> See [the install guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl).

1. `yq` / **YAML parsing command-line tool**: <br /> The CLI for
   Kubernetes&mdash;allows you to run parse and transform YAML files. This is only used in Part II. <br
   /> See [the install guide](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq#install).

1. `mc` / **MinIO Client**: <br /> The CLI for MinIO&mdash;allows you to run commands against MinIO clusters. <br
   /> See [the install guide](https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-client-quickstart-guide.html).

1. `git` / **Git**: <br /> The CLI for Git&mdash;allows you to clone the Kratix repository. <br
   /> See [the install guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

:::info

You can run the workshop without KinD. Ideally, you will have access to two
Kubernetes clusters.

One cluster will be the Platform cluster, where Kratix will be installed.
Whenever you see `--context kind-platform`, replace it with the context of your
platform cluster.

The other worker will be the Worker cluster. Whenever you see `--context
kind-worker`, replace it with the context of your worker cluster.

If you want to try it on a single cluster, you can omit the `--context` flag and
argument entirely.

## Docker Resources {#docker-config}

In order to complete all tutorials in this series, you must allocate enough
resources to Docker. Ensure you allocate at least:

* 5 CPU
* 12GB Memory
* 4GB swap

This can be managed through your tool of choice (e.g. Docker Desktop, Rancher, etc).

You are now ready to [create the clusters](./create-clusters) for the workshop!
