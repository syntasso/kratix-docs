title: "Creating the clusters"
description: In this section, you will create the Kubernetes clusters that will be used in the workshop. You will also configure the Worker to ensure it can run Kratix workloads.
---

One of the most powerful Kratix features is the ability platform teams have to fully control the scheduling of work across extensive and diverse infrastructure, i.e. to determine in which Kubernetes cluster (or other infrastructure) a certain workload should be deployed to. Kratix leverages the GitOps toolkit to deliver this capability.

Kratix itself runs in Kubernetes. The first step in getting Kratix up and running is to create a Kubernetes cluster where you can install it. In this workshop, you will use `kind` to run Kubernetes clusters locally.

:::info

You can run the workshop without KinD. Ideally, you will have access to two
Kubernetes clusters.

One cluster will be the Platform cluster, where Kratix will be installed.
Whenever you see `--context $PLATFORM`, replace it with the context of your
platform cluster.

The other worker will be the Worker cluster. Whenever you see `--context
$WORKER`, replace it with the context of your worker cluster.

If you want to try it on a single cluster, you can omit the `--context` flag and
argument entirely.

:::


Within the Kratix repository, you will find two KinD configuration files that will make it easier to interact with the clusters. Start by cloning the repository locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/syntasso/kratix
cd kratix
```

You can now create the **Platform** cluster with the following command:

```bash
# make sure there are no clusters running
kind delete clusters --all

kind create cluster \
    --name platform \
    --image kindest/node:v1.27.3 \
    --config config/samples/kind-platform-config.yaml
```

The **Platform** cluster is the Kubernetes cluster where Kratix will be installed. It will also be the cluster where the Platform team will manage the Kratix configuration.

Although it is possible to schedule workloads to the Platform cluster, it is not generally where most of the workloads will be deployed to.
More often, platform teams will have a dedicated set of clusters (and other varied infrastructure) where the requested services will actually run. In this workshop, you will use a second cluster to simulate this scenario. Whenever you read **Worker** cluster in the workshop, it will refer to this second cluster.

Create the **Worker** cluster with the following command:

```bash
kind create cluster \
    --name worker \
    --image kindest/node:v1.27.3 \
    --config config/samples/kind-worker-config.yaml
```

To make it easier to interact with both clusters, set the `PLATFORM` and `WORKER` environment variables with each cluster context:

```bash
export PLATFORM="kind-platform"
export WORKER="kind-worker"
```

You can validate your clusters are running with the `cluster-info` command:

```shell-session
$ kubectl --context $PLATFORM cluster-info
Kubernetes control plane is running at https://127.0.0.1:65003
CoreDNS is running at https://127.0.0.1:65003/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

$ kubectl --context $WORKER cluster-info
Kubernetes control plane is running at https://127.0.0.1:65004
CoreDNS is running at https://127.0.0.1:65004/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
```
## Install the Platform Prerequisites

### Cert-manager

Kratix requires [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) to be installed in the cluster. Cert-manager is a Kubernetes add-on that automates the management and issuance of TLS certificates from various issuing sources.

To install it, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM apply --filename https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.12.0/cert-manager.yaml
```

You can validate cert-manager is running with the following command:

```shell-session
$ kubectl --context $PLATFORM get pods --namespace cert-manager
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cert-manager-7476c8fcf4-r8cnd             1/1     Running   0          19s
cert-manager-cainjector-bdd866bd4-7d8zp   1/1     Running   0          19s
cert-manager-webhook-5655dcfb4b-54r49     1/1     Running   0          19s
```

### MinIO as the GitOps Repository

As mentioned before, Kratix leverages GitOps for deploying and reconciling
scheduled workloads. That means that Kratix needs a backing service to serve as the state store. Kraix supports two types of state stores: S3-compatible buckets and Git repositories. In this workshop, you will use a MinIO instance running in the platform cluster as the state store. In productions environment, you will probably use a Git repository or a S3-compatible bucket in a cloud provider.

To install MinIO in the platform, run:

```bash
# from the root of the Kratix repository
kubectl --context $PLATFORM apply --filename config/samples/minio-install.yaml
```

The above command will:

- Deploy an instance of MinIO on the `kratix-platform-system` namespace
- Create a Secret with the MinIO credentials
- Run a Job to create a bucket called `kratix` on the MinIO instance. <br />

You can verify the installation by running:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM get deployments --namespace kratix-platform-system
```

The above command will give an output similar to:

```shell-session
NAME     READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
minio    1/1     1            1           1h
```

You can also verify the Create Bucket job:

```
kubectl --context $PLATFORM get jobs
```

The above command will give an output similar to:

```shell-session
NAME                  COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
minio-create-bucket   1/1           3m5s       1h
```

Once the Job completes, you should be able to see the `kratix` bucket in the MinIO instance using the `mc` CLI:

```bash
# configure the mc CLI to use the MinIO instance
mc alias set kind http://localhost:31337 minioadmin minioadmin

# list the buckets
mc ls kind/
```

The above command will give an output similar to:

```shell-session
[2021-10-13 15:10:00 CEST]     0B kratix/
```

You platform cluster is now ready to receive Kratix!

## Install the Worker prerequisites

Kratix schedules works by writing a state declaration (following the Kubernetes
declare-and-converge pattern) to a designated State Store. When it comes to
reconciling the declared state, Kratix remains agnostic about the specific tool
to be used on the clusters. In this tutorial, you will utilise
[Flux](https://fluxcd.io/) on the worker, and configure it to reconcile the
state from the MinIO bucket.

To install and configure Flux, run the following script from the Kratix
repository:

```bash
./scripts/install-gitops --context $WORKER --path worker-cluster
```

The script above will:

- Install Flux
- Create a new Flux `Bucket` Source
- Create two Flux `Kustomizations`

The Flux `Kustomizations` are responsible for continuously reconciling with the state
declared in the `Source`.

If you are curious to know what this script does, or would prefer to configure the worker cluster yourself, take a look at the section below.


<details>
<summary>Configuring the cluster: the manual way</summary>

If you prefer to configure the worker cluster manually, follow the steps below.

Install Flux on the worker cluster:

```bash
kubectl --context $WORKER apply --filename https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/download/v2.0.0-rc.3/install.yaml
```

Next, Flux must be configured to read from the MinIO bucket. For that, you will create a new
Flux [Bucket Source](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/buckets/),
together with a Secret containing the bucket credentials.

:::caution

You may notice that the value of the Bucket `endpoint` on the document below is
set to `172.18.0.2:31337`.

Flux now needs to access MinIO _across_ clusters, so you will need to use
an externally available endpoint.

`172.18.0.2` will often be the address of the platform cluster running on KinD.
You can confirm this address with the following command:

```bash
docker inspect platform-control-plane | grep '"IPAddress": "172' | awk -F '"' '{print $4}'
```

The above command will give an output similar to:

```shell-session
172.18.0.2
```

If the command above outputs a different IP, make sure to update the Bucket
configuration below accordingly.

The port part of the endpoint should always be 31337. Verify the NodePort of the
MinIO service in the platform cluster:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM get services minio --namespace kratix-platform-system
```

The above command will give an output similar to:

```shell-session
NAME    TYPE       CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
minio   NodePort   10.96.45.28   <none>        80:31337/TCP   1h
```

:::

Create the Flux Source Bucket (and Secret):

```yaml
cat <<EOF | kubectl --context $WORKER apply -f -
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: minio-credentials
  namespace: flux-system
type: Opaque
stringData:
  accesskey: minioadmin
  secretkey: minioadmin
---
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1
kind: Bucket
metadata:
  name: kratix-bucket
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 10s
  provider: generic
  bucketName: kratix
  endpoint: 172.18.0.2:31337 # make sure to read the caution box above
  insecure: true
  secretRef:
    name: minio-credentials
EOF
```

The above command will give an output similar to:

```shell-session
secret/minio-credentials created
bucket.source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/kratix-bucket created
```

This tutorial will not dive into details of how to configure Flux Sources, but please read on their
[documentation](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/) if you are curious.

Once the Bucket Source is created, validate that Flux can reach the bucket:

```bash
kubectl --context $WORKER get buckets.source.toolkit.fluxcd.io --namespace flux-system
```

The above command will give an output similar to:

```shell-session
NAME            ENDPOINT           AGE     READY   STATUS
kratix-bucket   172.18.0.2:31337   1h      True    stored artifact: revision 'sha256:some-sha'
```

Next, you must tell Flux what to do with this Source. Flux does continuous
delivery through the [Kustomize
Controller](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/kustomize/). You can define a Flux
`Kustomization` that watches for a Source and reconciles on events.

Create the Flux Kustomizations:

```yaml
cat <<EOF | kubectl --context $WORKER apply --filename -
---
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: kratix-workload-dependencies
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 8s
  prune: true
  sourceRef:
    kind: Bucket
    name: kratix-bucket
  path: ./worker-cluster/dependencies
---
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: kratix-workload-resources
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 3s
  prune: true
  dependsOn:
  - name: kratix-workload-dependencies
  sourceRef:
    kind: Bucket
    name: kratix-bucket
  path: ./worker-cluster/resources
EOF
```

The above command will give an output similar to:

```shell-session
kustomization.kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/kratix-workload-dependencies created
kustomization.kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/kratix-workload-resources created
```

You will notice that there are two Kustomizations created. When scheduling
workloads, Kratix will separate the documents based on their GVK (Group, Version,
Kind):

- All dependencies (i.e. the Custom Resource Definition as defined
  [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.27/#customresourcedefinition-v1-apiextensions-k8s-io))
  will be written to a specific `dependencies` path within the State Store.
- All other documents will be written to a specific `resources` path within the
  State Store.

Later when you register the cluster as a Destination, Kratix will use the cluster's `namespace`
and `name` to build the full path for that cluster within the State Store.

The first Kustomization above is for dependencies (CRDs), while the second is for the other
resources (note the `spec.path`). You can also note that the
`kratix-workload-resources` depends on the `kratix-workload-dependencies`. That's to
avoid failures when a resource documents uses a GVK being defined by a CRD
document.

For further details on the naming convention for the buckets and paths, check
the [documentation](../main/reference/statestore/intro). For more on
Kustomizations, check [the Flux docs
page](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/kustomize/kustomization/)

</details>

Wait for Flux to start:

```bash
kubectl --context $WORKER get deployments --namespace flux-system --watch
```

The above command will give an output similar to:

```shell-session
NAME                      READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
helm-controller           1/1     1            1           10m
kustomize-controller      1/1     1            1           10m
notification-controller   1/1     1            1           10m
source-controller         1/1     1            1           10m
```

Once the Ready column reports `1/1`, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to
exit the watch mode.

At this stage, you environment looks like this:

```mdx-code-block
import Topology00 from "/img/docs/workshop/topology-00.png"
```

You are now ready to move to [Part I and install Kratix](../part-i/intro)!
