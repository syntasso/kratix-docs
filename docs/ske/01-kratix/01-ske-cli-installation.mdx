Syntasso Kratix Enterprise images are distributed through a private image registry. To
install SKE on your Kubernetes cluster, follow the steps below.

## Install

:::info

Syntasso Kratix Enterprise requires cert-manager to be installed on the cluster. Please
refer to [its documentation for installation instructions](https://cert-manager.io/).

:::

The easiest way to install SKE is using the [SKE
CLI](../50-releases/40-ske-cli.mdx). The CLI will install the SKE Operator and
configure it to deploy SKE on your cluster. To install run:

```
ske install --access-token $SKE_LICENCE_TOKEN
```

### Verify the installation

Once installation is complete you can verify what has been installed by running:

```bash
ske get version
```

You should see the following output (or similar):
```shell-session
Latest Available:
SKE Operator: v0.2.0; SKE Deployment: v0.3.0

Deployed:
SKE Operator: v0.2.0; SKE Deployment: v0.3.0
```

To verify that the Operator and SKE are healthy, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl get deployments.apps --namespace kratix-platform-system
```

You should see the following output:

```shell-session
NAME                                 READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
kratix-platform-controller-manager   1/1     1            1           1h
ske-operator-controller-manager      1/1     1            1           1h
```

You can now proceed with the configuration of Kratix (i.e. registering destinations or
installing promises). For that, refer to the Open-Source Kratix documentation.

## Upgrades

Support for upgrading SKE using the SKE CLI is coming soon. In the meantime, you can
follow the [helm upgrade](./02-helm-installation.mdx) instructions for upgrading SKE.

## Air-gapped installations

Support for installing SKE in air-gapped environments using the SKE CLI is coming
soon. In the meantime, you can follow the [helm
installation](./02-helm-installation.mdx) instructions for air-gapped environments.
