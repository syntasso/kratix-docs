Syntasso Kratix Enterprise images are distributed through a private image registry. To
install SKE on your Kubernetes cluster, follow the steps below.

## Install SKE operator

:::info

Syntasso Kratix Enterprise requires cert-manager to be installed on the cluster. Please
refer to [its documentation for installation instructions](https://cert-manager.io/).

:::

To install SKE operator using the Helm chart, start by adding the Syntasso Helm
repository:

```bash
helm repo add syntasso https://syntasso.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

Next, install the SKE Operator:

```bash
helm install ske-operator syntasso/ske-operator \
  --namespace kratix-platform-system \
  --create-namespace \
  --set skeDeployment.enabled=true \
  --set skeDeployment.version=v0.3.0
```

<details>
<summary>Alternative installation method</summary>

If you prefer not to use Helm, you can install the SKE operator by applying the
manifests directly.

First, create the namespace where the SKE operator will be installed:

```bash
kubectl create namespace kratix-platform-system
```

Then, create a secret with your license token:

```
kubectl create secret docker-registry syntasso-registry \
  --namespace=kratix-platform-system \
  --docker-server=ghcr.io \
  --docker-username=syntasso-pkg \
  --docker-password=<YOUR TOKEN>
```

The manifests are available in the [Syntasso Releases
Page](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/#ske-operator/).
Find the latest release and apply it with `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f http://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/syntasso-enterprise-releases/ske-operator/v0.1.6/ske-operator-distribution.yaml
```

With the Operator in place, you can now install Kratix Enterprise by creating a
'Kratix' instance. Below is an example 'Kratix' instance definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.syntasso.io/v1alpha1
kind: Kratix
metadata:
  name: kratix-example
spec:
  releasesBucket:
    name: # name of the bucket containing Kratix Enterprise releases; optional
    region: # region of the bucket; optional
    path: # subpath within the bucket; optional
  version: v0.3.0 # version of Kratix Enterprise to install; default to the latest release found in release bucket
```

You can save the 'Kratix' instance definition to a local file and apply with kubectl.
SKE operator will then install Kratix Enterprise and its necessary configurations.

By default, when `spec.releasesBucket` is not set, SKE operator will use the Syntasso Enterprise releases bucket.
Note that 'Kratix' is a cluster scoped and singleton resource.

Only one instance of Kratix can be installed in a cluster.

</details>

### Verify the installation

To verify that Kratix Enterprise has been installed successfully, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl get deployments.apps --namespace kratix-platform-system
```

You should see the following output:

```shell-session
NAME                                 READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
kratix-platform-controller-manager   1/1     1            1           1h
ske-operator-controller-manager      1/1     1            1           1h
```

You can now proceed with the configuration of Kratix (i.e. registering destinations or
installing promises). For that, refer to the Open-Source Kratix documentation.

## Upgrades

### Upgrading the Operator

To verify the version of the Operator installed, run the following command:

```bash
helm list
```

You should see the following output:

```shell-session
NAME            NAMESPACE    [...]    CHART                   APP VERSION
ske-operator    default      [...]    ske-operator-0.8.0      v0.1.1
```

To check the available versions of the Operator, run the following command:

```bash
helm search repo syntasso/ske-operator --versions
```

To upgrade, run:

```bash
helm upgrade ske-operator syntasso/ske-operator # --version <VERSION>
```

:::info Not using Helm?

Refer to the alternative installation method summary box above to upgrade the operator without Helm.

:::

### Upgrading the SKE Instance

To upgrade the version of SKE being deployed by the operator, you can edit your
Kratix instance definition and change the `version` field to the desired
version.

Upgrades from a version vX.Y.Z to vX.Y+2.Z are not supported. You must upgrade to
vX.Y+1.Z first.

## Deletes

### Deleting the SKE Operator

To delete the SKE operator (and any deployed SKE instance), run the following command:

```bash
helm uninstall ske-operator
```

### Deleting the SKE Instance

To delete the SKE instance, run:

```
kubectl -n kratix-platform-system delete kratix <INSTANCE_NAME>
```

## Air-gapped installations

To deploy the SKE Operator in air-gapped environments, you need to ensure that
your Platform cluster has access to the following resources:

- An image registry containing both the SKE Operator and the SKE images
- A location where the SKE Distribution manifests can be found

The following sections detail how both resources can be set up.

### Image Registry

The SKE Operator and SKE images are stored in the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR). To
deploy SKE in an air-gapped environment, you need to mirror the images to a private
registry.

You must ensure that the following images are mirrored and tagged according to
the version.

- `ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-operator`
- `ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-platform`
- `ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-platform-pipeline-adapter`

:::warning Platform and Pipeline Adapter tags

The tags for the `ske-platform` and the `ske-platform-pipeline-adapter` images are
the same and must match the version of the SKE deployment you wish to install.

:::

You can find the available versions of the images in the [Syntasso Enterprise
Releases page](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/).


:::tip

You can use a tool like [Skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo) to simplify the
process of mirroring images.

:::

### SKE Manifests

The manifests for SKE deployments are available in the [Syntasso Enterprise
Releases page](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/).

If you are deploying SKE in an air-gapped environment, you need to download the
manifests and make them available to the SKE Operator in a S3-compatible bucket
that's accessible from the Platform cluster.


### Setting up your Platform cluster

Depending on your environment configuration, you may need to create the
secrets the Operator will use to access both the Image Registry and the
Bucket. Those credentials must exist in the `kratix-platform-system` namespace.

:::tip

You may need to, first, create the namespace:

```bash
kubectl create namespace kratix-platform-system
```

:::

To create the Image Registry secret, run:

```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry <PULL SECRET NAME> \
    --namespace "kratix-platform-system" \
    --docker-username="yourusername" \
    --docker-password="yourpassword" \
    --docker-server="your.registry.address"
```

To create the Bucket secret, run:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic <BUCKET SECRET NAME> \
    --namespace kratix-platform-system \
    --from-literal=accessKeyID="youraccesskey" \
    --from-literal=secretAccessKey="yoursecretkey"
```


### Deploying the SKE Operator

Once you have the images mirrored and the manifests available, you can deploy
the SKE Operator with Helm by providing the necessary configuration. Please
check the [Helm chart values
file](https://github.com/syntasso/helm-charts/blob/main/ske-operator/values.yaml)
for a complete list of configuration options.

```bash
helm install ske-operator syntasso/ske-operator \
  --namespace kratix-platform-system \
  --set skeLicense=<YOUR LICENSE TOKEN> \
  --set imageRegistry.host=<YOUR REGISTRY> \
  --set imageRegistry.imagePullSecret=<PULL SECRET NAME> \
  --set imageRegistry.skeOperatorImage.name=<OPERATOR IMAGE NAME> \
  --set imageRegistry.skeOperatorImage.tag=<OPERATOR IMAGE TAG> \
  --set imageRegistry.skePlatformImage.name=<SKE PLATFORM IMAGE NAME> \
  --set imageRegistry.skePlatformPipelineAdapterImage.name=<SKE PLATFORM PIPELINE ADAPTER IMAGE NAME> \
  --set releasesBucket.name=<BUCKET NAME> \
  --set releasesBucket.path=<BUCKET PATH> \
  --set releasesBucket.region=<BUCKET REGION> \
  --set releasesBucket.endpoint=<BUCKET ENDPOINT> \
  --set releasesBucket.secretName=<BUCKET SECRET NAME> \
  --set skeDeployment.enabled=true \
  --set skeDeployment.version=v0.3.0
```

:::tip

Most of the configuration options are optional. You only need to provide the
ones that you have customised to your environment.
