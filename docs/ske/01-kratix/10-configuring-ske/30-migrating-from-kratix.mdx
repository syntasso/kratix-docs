title: Migrating from Kratix to SKE
description: Installing Syntasso Kratix Enterprise when you have already Kratix installed
---

If you already have a Kratix deployment in your environment, installing the SKE Operator and a new SKE instance will
remove the existing Kratix setup. By default, only one SKE or Kratix instance can run in a cluster at the same time.
Kubernetes leader election will delete the former deployment automatically. If that doesn't happen, you can manually
delete the former deployment. This will have no effect on your running Promises or Resources.

Keep in mind that [pre-upgrade checks](/ske/kratix/ske-operator#pre-upgrade-checks) wonâ€™t be run, because the SKE
instance is created from scratch. Also, all the Kratix resources (e.g. Promises, Resources, etc.) will be reconciled.
