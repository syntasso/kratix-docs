title: Via SKE CLI
description: Installing Syntasso Kratix Enterprise via the SKE CLI
---

The easiest way to get started with SKE is to use the SKE CLI.

The CLI will install the SKE Operator and configure it to deploy SKE on your cluster.

To install SKE on your Kubernetes cluster via the CLI, follow the steps below.

:::info

The SKE CLI needs access to the private registry which Syntasso Kratix Enterprise images
are distributed through. Support for installing SKE in **air-gapped environments** instead
using the SKE CLI is coming soon.

In the meantime, you can follow the [setup for air-gapped environments](./air-gapped)
instructions, and then [install using Helm](./via-helm) or by [directly applying the manifests](./via-manifest).
:::

## Installing the SKE CLI

Instructions for installing the SKE CLI can be found [here](../../ske-cli/ske-cli-intro#installation).

## Installing SKE

To install the SKE Operator and a SKE instance, run:

```
ske install --access-token $SKE_LICENSE_TOKEN
```

:::info

By default Syntasso Kratix Enterprise requires `cert-manager` to be installed on
the cluster. Please refer to [its documentation for installation
instructions](https://cert-manager.io/).

If you wish to install SKE without `cert-manager`, you can do so by following the
[Helm Installation instructions](./via-helm#custom-certs).

:::

### Verify the installation

Once installation is complete you can verify what has been installed by running:

```bash
ske get version
```

You should see the following output (or similar):
```shell-session
Latest Available:
SKE Operator: v0.2.0; SKE Deployment: v0.3.0

Deployed:
SKE Operator: v0.2.0; SKE Deployment: v0.3.0
```

To verify that the Operator and SKE are healthy, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl get deployments.apps --namespace kratix-platform-system
```

You should see the following output:

```shell-session
NAME                                 READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
kratix-platform-controller-manager   1/1     1            1           1h
ske-operator-controller-manager      1/1     1            1           1h
```

You can now proceed with the configuration of Kratix (i.e. registering destinations or
installing promises). For that, refer to the [appropriate guide](/category/guides).

## Upgrades

To upgrade your SKE instance via the CLI, you can run:

```shell-session
ske upgrade [--version <desired version>]
```

By default, the SKE Operator will perform the following steps:
1. Run the pre-upgrade checks to check that Kratix is safe to upgrade in its current state.
1. Upgrade your Kratix Deployment to the new version. If no version is
   specified, it will upgrade to the next minor version.
1. Wait for the Kratix Deployment to become healthy (ready and available).

:::tip

If the specified version is not the next minor, the SKE Operator will perform
the upgrade to all the minors in between. Check the [Operator
docs](/ske/kratix/ske-operator#upgrade) for more details.

:::

### Upgrade checks

The SKE Operator will perform [pre-upgrade checks](../ske-operator#pre-upgrade-checks) as part of the upgrade flow.

To skip these checks, you can use the `--skip-all-checks` flag when starting an upgrade:

```shell-session
ske upgrade --skip-all-checks
```

:::tip
Skipping checks can be useful when you need to upgrade SKE while its current state is
unhealthy.
:::

### Timeouts

The SKE CLI has a default 5-minute timeout for monitoring an upgrade. This can be
configured by using the `--timeout` flag:

```shell-session
ske upgrade --timeout 10m0s
```

:::info
The SKE CLI timeout is only enforced while monitoring an upgrade. Timing out on the CLI will not
fail the upgrade, and progress can still be monitored by checking the status of the Kratix
resource.
