## Prerequisites

### Create the namespace

To install the SKE Operator via the [distribution manifest](../../releases/ske-operator),
you will first need to create the `kratix-platform-system` namespace. This is where the
SKE operator will be installed:

```bash
kubectl create namespace kratix-platform-system
```

### Create the Operator configuration

If you are not running SKE in an air-gapped environment, all you need to do is create a secret with your license token:

```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry syntasso-registry \
  --namespace=kratix-platform-system \
  --docker-server=ghcr.io \
  --docker-username=syntasso-pkg \
  --docker-password=<YOUR TOKEN>
```

For air-gapped environments, you will need to create a ConfigMap with the following structure:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: ske-operator
  namespace: kratix-platform-system
data:
  config: |
    releaseStorage:
      path: # path within the git repository or bucket to look for releases
      # one of: git or bucket
      git:
        secretName: # the name of the secret containing the git credentials
        repo: # the git repository to look for releases
        branch: # the branch to look for releases
      bucket:
        name: # the name of the bucket to look for releases
        endpoint: # the endpoint of the bucket
        region: # the region of the bucket
        secretName: # optional: the name of the secret containing the credentials to access the bucket
    imageRegistry:
      host: # the host of the image registry
      pullSecret: # optional: the name of the secret containing the image registry credentials
      platformImage: # the image of the platform
      pipelineImage: # the image of the pipeline adapter
```

Refer to the [air-gapped installations](./air-gapped) section for more
information on how to configure the underlying storage and image registry, as
well as the expected structure of the referenced secrets.

## Deploying the SKE Operator

With all of the prerequisites in place, the platform is now ready to deploy the
SKE Operator. Locate the desired release of the SKE-Operator and apply its
manifest with `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f http://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/syntasso-enterprise-releases/ske-operator/<VERSION>/ske-operator-distribution.yaml
```

Applying the manifest will install the SKE Operator in the
`kratix-platform-system` namespace, together with a Kratix Custom Resource
Definition (CRD) that allows you to manage the Syntasso Kratix Enterprise installation.

## Deploying SKE

The SKE Operator includes a custom resource definition (CRD) for managing
SKE. Only one instance of SKE can be created by the SKE Operator in a
given cluster.

To deploy SKE, create a file named `ske-instance.yaml` with the following contents:

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.syntasso.io/v1alpha1
kind: Kratix
metadata:
  name: my-kratix
spec:
  version: v0.99.0 # The desired version of SKE
```

Apply the file with `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl apply --filename ske-instance.yaml
```

The operator will then install SKE and its necessary configurations. For more
information about the Kratix CRD, see the [SKE Operator](../ske-operator)
documentation.

## Upgrading SKE Operator

To upgrade the SKE Operator, you can apply the new manifest directly:

```bash
kubectl apply -f http://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/syntasso-enterprise-releases/ske-operator/<NEW-VERSION>/ske-operator-distribution.yaml
```

## Upgrading SKE

To upgrade the SKE instance, you can apply a new version of the Kratix CRD:

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.syntasso.io/v1alpha1
kind: Kratix
metadata:
  name: my-kratix
spec:
  version: v0.100.0 # New desired version
```

### Upgrade checks

The SKE Operator will perform [pre-upgrade checks](../ske-operator#pre-upgrade-checks)
and [post-upgrade checks](../ske-operator#post-upgrade-checks) as part of the upgrade flow.

To skip these checks, you can add the
`ske.syntasso.io/skip-all-upgrade-checks` label when updating your `.spec.version`:

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.syntasso.io/v1alpha1
kind: Kratix
metadata:
  name: my-kratix
  #highlight-start
  labels:
    ske.syntasso.io/skip-all-upgrade-checks: "true"
  #highlight-end
spec:
  version: v0.100.0 # New desired version
```

:::tip
Skipping checks can be useful when you need to upgrade SKE while its current state is
unhealthy.
:::

### Handling failures

If any upgrade step fails, the SKE Operator will continue looping its reconciliation of
the Kratix resource to pick up any manual fixes. See the section on [handling
failures](../ske-operator#handling-failures) for more details.

## Deleting SKE Operator

To delete the SKE Operator (and any deployed SKE instance), run the following command:

```bash
kubectl delete -f http://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/syntasso-enterprise-releases/ske-operator/<VERSION>/ske-operator-distribution.yaml
```

:::warning

This will delete the SKE Operator and any deployed SKE instance, including all Promises
and Resource Requests.

:::

## Deleting SKE Instance

To delete the SKE instance, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl delete kratixes my-kratix
```
