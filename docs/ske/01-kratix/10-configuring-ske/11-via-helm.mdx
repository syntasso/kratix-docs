```

Syntasso Kratix Enterprise images are distributed through a private image registry. To
install SKE on your Kubernetes cluster, follow the steps below.

## Install SKE operator

### Prerequisites

:::info

Syntasso Kratix Enterprise requires cert-manager to be installed on the cluster
unless you are configuring [custom certificates](#custom-certs). Please
refer to [its documentation for installation instructions](https://cert-manager.io/).

:::

To install SKE operator using the Helm chart, start by adding the Syntasso Helm
repository:

```bash
helm repo add syntasso https://syntasso.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

### Configuring your values

Helm can accept values via the values file. Refer to the examples
below for common configuration options. Any configuration should be placed in a
`values.yaml` file that is then passed in to the `helm install` command.

:::tip

You can see all available configuration in the
[helm chart repository](https://github.com/syntasso/helm-charts/blob/main/ske-operator/values.yaml).
:::

#### Required configuration

```yaml
skeLicense: LICENSE # provided to you by Syntasso
```

#### SKE version

The Helm chart version determines what version of the SKE Operator is installed.
To configure the version of SKE that the operator will install, you can use the
`skeDeployment.version` field as shown below.

```yaml
skeDeployment:
  version: v0.99.0 # select your desired version
```

#### Mirrored Image Registry

Add this configuration to your helm values file if you are following
the [air-gapped setup](./air-gapped) instructions for a self-hosted
Image Registry.

```yaml
imageRegistry:
  host: "ghcr.io"
  imagePullSecret: "my-secret"
  skeOperatorImage:
    name: "syntasso/ske-operator"
  skePlatformImage:
    name: "syntasso/ske-platform"
  skePlatformPipelineAdapterImage:
    name: "syntasso/ske-platform-pipeline-adapter"
```

#### Mirrored Release Storage

Add this configuration to your helm values file if you are following
the [air-gapped setup](./air-gapped) instructions for a self-hosted
Release Storage.

          secret:

            username: "my-username" # instead of providing a secretName you can provide the username and password directly

            password: "my-password"
    ```

#### Configuring TLS Certificates for SKE Operator and Deployment {#custom-certs}

By default, the SKE Operator and the SKE instance it deploys use cert-manager to
manage TLS certificates for their webhooks. This default setup requires no
additional configuration. However, if you prefer not to use cert-manager, you
can disable it and manually provide your own TLS certificates.

To disable cert-manager and supply your custom certificates, update your
configuration as follows:

```yaml
global:
  skeOperator:
    tlsConfig:
      certManager:
        disabled: true
      webhookCACert: |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        ...
      webhookTLSKey: |
        -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
        ...
      webhookTLSCert: |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        ...

skeDeployment:
  enabled: true
  tlsConfig:
    certManager:
      disabled: true
    webhookCACert: |
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      ...
    webhookTLSKey: |
      -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
      ...
    webhookTLSCert: |
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      ...
```

Both the SKE Operator and SKE Deployment require valid TLS certificates for
their webhook servers to securely communicate with the Kubernetes API. Below are
the DNS names that must be included in the TLS certificates for each component.

The TLS certificate for the SKE Operator's webhook server must cover the
following DNS names:

- `ske-operator-webhook-service.kratix-platform-system.svc`
- `ske-operator-webhook-service.kratix-platform-system.svc.cluster.local`

The TLS certificate for the SKE Deployment's webhook server must cover the
following DNS names:

- `kratix-platform-webhook-service.kratix-platform-system.svc`
- `kratix-platform-webhook-service.kratix-platform-system.svc.cluster.local`


### Installing the Operator

Next, install the SKE Operator:

```bash
helm install ske-operator syntasso/ske-operator \
  --namespace kratix-platform-system \
  --create-namespace \
  --wait \
  --values values.yaml # This is optional. Only use if you are configuring custom values.
```

<details>
<summary>Alternative installation method</summary>

If you prefer not to use Helm, you can install the SKE Operator by applying the
manifests directly. Check [SKE Operator](./via-manifest) for the instructions.

</details>

### Verify the installation

To verify that Syntasso Kratix Enterprise has been installed successfully, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl get deployments.apps --namespace kratix-platform-system
```

You should see the following output:

```shell-session
NAME                                 READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
kratix-platform-controller-manager   1/1     1            1           1h
ske-operator-controller-manager      1/1     1            1           1h
```

You can now proceed with the configuration of Kratix (i.e. registering destinations or
installing promises). For that, refer to the Open-Source Kratix documentation.


## Upgrades

### Upgrading the Operator

To verify the version of the Operator installed, run the following command:

```bash
helm list
```

You should see the following output:

```shell-session
NAME            NAMESPACE    [...]    CHART                   APP VERSION
ske-operator    default      [...]    ske-operator-0.8.0      v0.1.1
```

To check the available versions of the Operator, run the following command:

```bash
helm search repo syntasso/ske-operator --versions
```

To upgrade, run:

```bash
helm upgrade ske-operator syntasso/ske-operator \
  --version <CHART VERSION> --values values.yaml
```

:::info Not using Helm?

Refer to the alternative installation method summary box above to upgrade the operator without Helm.

:::

### Upgrading the SKE Instance

To upgrade the version of SKE being deployed by the operator, you can edit your
Kratix instance definition and change the `version` field to the desired
version.

The SKE Operator will perform [pre-upgrade checks](../ske-operator#pre-upgrade-checks) as part of the upgrade flow.

:::info

It is not possible to skip upgrade checks when upgrading via Helm. If you would like to
use this feature, we recommend that you [install via the SKE CLI](./via-ske-cli) or by
[directly applying the manifests](./via-manifest).

:::

## Deletions

### Deleting the SKE Operator

To delete the SKE operator (and any deployed SKE instance), run the following command:

```bash
helm uninstall ske-operator
```

### Deleting the SKE Instance

To delete the SKE instance, run:

```
kubectl -n kratix-platform-system delete kratix <INSTANCE_NAME>
```
