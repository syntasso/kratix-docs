```

You may want to manage SKE manifests and images within your own environment either
due to air-gapped requirements or other security and redundancy measures.

Regardless of the reason, if you want to host your own manifests and/or images you
will need to ensure that your Platform cluster has access to the following resources:

- An image registry containing the SKE Operator and additional SKE integration images
- A location where the SKE Release manifests can be found

Depending on your environment configuration, you will be instructed how to create
configuration and secrets the SKE Operator requires to access both the Image
Registry and manifest locations.


Manifests include reference to the SKE docker images. Do not directly change the manifest
to reference your image storage. If you need to change the image locations, you can do so
by using the image registry configuration fields on the SKE Operator which is documented
below.


## Image Registry

The SKE Operator and SKE images are stored in the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).

You must ensure that the following images are mirrored to your own image registry and
tagged according to the version.

- `registry.syntasso.io/ske-operator`
- `registry.syntasso.io/ske-platform`
- `registry.syntasso.io/ske-platform-pipeline-adapter`

:::warning Platform and Pipeline Adapter tags

The tags for the `ske-platform` and the `ske-platform-pipeline-adapter` images are
the same and must match the version of the SKE deployment you wish to install.

:::

You can find the available versions of the images in the [Syntasso Enterprise
Releases page](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/).


:::tip

You can use a tool like [Skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo) to simplify the
process of mirroring images.

### Providing SKE Operator access to use your image registry

You need provide the SKE Operator with both the credentials and location to read your
image registry.

To create the Image Registry secret, run:

```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry <PULL SECRET NAME> \
    --namespace "kratix-platform-system" \
    --docker-username="<YOURUSERNAME>" \
    --docker-password="<YOURPASSWORD>" \
    --docker-server="<YOUR.REGISTRY.ADDRESS>"
```

You will need to reference this secret when installing SKE operator which is described in
each installation guide.


## SKE Release Storage

The manifests for SKE deployments are available in the [Syntasso Enterprise
Releases page](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/).

You need to host the manifests in your own S3-compatible bucket or Git repository that's
accessible from the Platform cluster.

The contents must match exactly the structure of the Syntasso Enterprise releases bucket.

In Git, all files/directories starting with `.` are ignored.

###  Providing SKE Operator access to use your release registry

To create the secret to access the SKE Release Storage:

<Tabs className="boxedTabs" groupId="stateStore">
  <TabItem value="bucket" label="Mirroring from Bucket">

  ```bash
  kubectl create secret generic <BUCKET SECRET NAME> \
      --namespace kratix-platform-system \
      --from-literal=accessKeyID="<YOURACCESSKEY>" \
      --from-literal=secretAccessKey="<YOURSECRETKEY>"
  ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="git" label="Mirroring from Git Repo">

  ```bash
  kubectl create secret generic <GIT SECRET NAME> \
      --namespace kratix-platform-system \
      --from-literal=username="<USERNAME>" \
      --from-literal=password="<PASSWORD>"
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


You will need to reference this secret when installing SKE operator which is described in
each installation guide.
