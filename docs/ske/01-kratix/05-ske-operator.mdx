description: Documentation about the SKE Operator

The SKE Operator provides full lifecycle support for Syntasso Kratix Enterprise (SKE) and is the
recommended approach for installing and managing your SKE installation.

The operator has its own [releases](../releases/ske-operator) and it manages instances of
SKE as defined by a [Kratix Custom Resource](#the-kratix-custom-resource-definition-crd).

:::info

While SKE is can be installed directly via the [released SKE distribution
manifests](../releases/ske#overview), we **highly recommend** that you use the SKE Operator.

Using the Operator will reduce the workload of maintaining SKE, and all future operational
features will only be available via the Operator.

:::

## Features

The SKE Operator will:

* Install a Kratix instance into your cluster, including dependencies
* Prevent drift of Kratix resources by continuously reconciling them against the declared
[SKE distribution](../releases/ske#overview)
* Validate SKE is in a healthy state before upgrading with pre-upgrade checks
* Roll out an upgrade to the next minor version at the latest patch
* Provide information about the status of the upgrade

## The Kratix Custom Resource Definition (CRD)

The Kratix CRD is the resource definition corresponding to a Kratix installation. This
resource is managed by the SKE Operator.

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.syntasso.io/v1alpha1
kind: Kratix
metadata:
  name: my-kratix
spec:
  version: vX.Y.Z # The desired version of SKE, can be set to latest
```

The Kratix resource is the owner of all resources installed as part of the [SKE
distribution](../releases/ske#overview), and ensures that their state always matches the
definition in the distribution manifest.

## Managing Kratix via the SKE Operator

### Install

Syntasso Kratix Enterprise supports many ways of installing a Kratix instance. See
[Configuring SKE](./configuring-ske/intro) for details.

### Upgrade

To upgrade the SKE instance, you can apply a new version to the Kratix CRD:

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.syntasso.io/v1alpha1
kind: Kratix
metadata:
  name: my-kratix
spec:
  version: latest # Or new desired version
```

:::tip

If you set the `spec.version` to `latest`, the SKE Operator may automatically
upgrade your Kratix instance to the latest compatible version of SKE, whenever a
new version is available and a reconciliation loop is triggered.

At this moment, the SKE Operator will not automatically check for new versions.

:::

By default, the SKE Operator will perform the following steps:
1. Validate that the current Kratix installation is in a healthy state.
1. Upgrade your Kratix Deployment to the next compatible version.
1. Wait for the Kratix Deployment to become healthy (ready and available).
1. Repeat the above steps until the desired version is reached.

:::info

The Operator will stop the upgrade process if:

1. A new major is reached, or
1. No valid upgrade path is found.

Patch versions on the same minor can be upgraded without restrictions.

Downgrades are not currently supported by the SKE Operator.
