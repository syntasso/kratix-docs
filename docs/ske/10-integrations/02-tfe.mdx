Kratix supports scheduling workloads via Promises to run on HCP Terraform (Terraform
Cloud) or Terraform Enterprise.

This page provides information on how to:

1. Configure TFE as a Kratix Destination.
1. Write a Promise that can schedule workloads to TFE.
1. Use the SKE Aspect to pull information out of TFE.

This documentation assumes the existence of a Terraform Workspace that's configured to
apply Terraform configurations from a Git repository. Please refer to the [TFE
documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/creating)
for more information on how to create and configure the Workspace.

## Configuring the Destination

Once you have a a Workspace configured to listen to a Git repository, you can
configure Kratix to be able to send workloads to it. To do this, you will first
need to create a GitStateStore pointing to the same Git repository you're using
for your TFE Workspace.

Create the GitStateStore, replacing the placeholders with your own values:

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: GitStateStore
metadata:
  name: workspace-repo
spec:
  authMethod: <AUTH METHOD>
  branch: <BRANCH>
  secretRef:
    name: <SECRET NAME>
    namespace: <NAMESPACE>
  url: <MY WORKSPACE REPOSITORY>
```

Refer to the [GitStateStore documentation](/main/reference/statestore/gitstatestore)
for more information on how to configure the GitStateStore.

Next, create a Secret with the credentials needed to access your TFE Workspace:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: tf-credentials
  namespace: default
stringData:
  organization: <TFE ORG NAME>
  token: <TFE TOKEN>
  workspace: <TFE WORKSPACE NAME>
```

To generate a token, refer to the [TFE
documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens.html).

You can now create a Destination, tying everything together:

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: Destination
metadata:
  name: tfe
  annotations:
    kratix.io/tf-credentials: '{"namespace": "default", "name": "tf-credentials"}'
  labels:
    environment: terraform
spec:
  filepath:
    mode: none
  stateStoreRef:
    kind: GitStateStore
    name: workspace-repo
```

<details>
<summary>Destination in detail</summary>

There are a few important things to note about the Destination above.

* The `spec.stateStoreRef` is pointing to the GitStateStore you created earlier.
* The `spec.filepath.mode` is set to `none`. That's because TFE does not support
  nested directories, which is how Kratix writes to the State Store by default.
  It also means your Promise needs to output unique files as part of the
  Pipeline, otherwise multiple requests will overwrite the same file.
* The `metadata.annotations.kratix.io/tf-credentials` is a JSON object that
  contains the reference to the Secret you created earlier. This is used by the
  SKE Aspect to pull information out of TFE.
* The `metadata.labels.environment` is set to `terraform`. This is not required.
  You will use that label later when writing your Promise.

</details>

With all the resources created, you can now write a Promise that schedules workloads to TFE.

## Writing a Promise

TFE does not support nested directories in the State Store, so your promise
needs to ensure the uniqueness of the files it writes.

Here's an example Promise that schedules a workload to TFE:

<details>
<summary>Example: Promise which schedules to TFE</summary>

          spec:

                args:

                  - |
                    cat <<EOF > /kratix/output/main.tf
                    output "promise-configure" {
                      value = "some-value"
                    }
                    EOF
    resource:
      configure:
        - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
          kind: Pipeline
          metadata:
            name: resource
            namespace: default
          spec:
            containers:

                args:

                  - |
                    name=$(yq '.metadata.name' /kratix/input/object.yaml)
                    name=$(yq '.metadata.namespace' /kratix/input/object.yaml)
                    cat <<EOF > /kratix/output/${name}-${namespace}.tf
                    output "${name}-${namespace}-resource-configure" {
                      value = "some-value"
                    }
                    EOF
```
</details>


Let's break down the Promise above. It starts with the `destinationSelectors`:

```yaml
spec:
  destinationSelectors:
    - matchLabels:
        environment: terraform
```

This Promise will only run on Destinations that have the label `environment:
terraform`. This is the label we set on the Destination earlier. The value of
the label is not important, as long as it's the same on the Destination and the
Promise. Please refer to [Managing Multiple
Destinations](/main/reference/destinations/multidestination-management) for more information.

Next, check the `spec.promise.configure` workflow. You will find the following
in the pipeline:

```bash
cat <<EOF > /kratix/output/main.tf
output "promise-configure" {
  value = "some-value"
}
EOF
```

Since the Promise workflow will run only once per Destination, the outputs it
generates need only be unique within a single Destination. Your Terraform code will
likely to be more complex, but this is a simple example to get you started.

Finally, check the `spec.resource.configure` workflow. You will find the
following:

```bash
name=$(yq '.metadata.name' /kratix/input/object.yaml)
name=$(yq '.metadata.namespace' /kratix/input/object.yaml)
cat <<EOF > /kratix/output/${name}-${namespace}.tf
output "${name}-${namespace}-resource-configure" {
  value = "some-value"
}
EOF
```

Since the Promise workflow will run once per resource, the outputs it generates
need to be unique. The example above uses the resource's name and namespace to
generate a unique filename and output name. You may need to adapt your code to follow the
same pattern.

## Adding the SKE TF State Finder Aspect

If you followed the steps above, you should now have a Promise that schedules
workloads to TFE. However, given that the Terraform code will be planned and
executed by TFE, the users of your Platform won't have access to the Terraform
outputs directly.

To solve this, you can use the SKE TF State Finder Aspect. This Aspect will pull the
Terraform outputs from TFE and make them available in the Resource's status.

To use the Aspect, you need to add it to your Promise as a second Pipeline in
the `spec.resource.configure` workflow:

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: Promise
# ...
spec:
  workflows:
    resource:
      configure:
        - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
          kind: Pipeline
          # ... workflow that generates the Terraform configuration files

        - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
          kind: Pipeline
          metadata:
            name: output-writer
            namespace: default
          spec:
            rbac:
              permissions:
              - apiGroups:
                  - ""
                resources:
                  - secrets
                verbs:
                  - get
                resourceNamespace: "*" # if the namespace of the secret is static this can be modified
              - apiGroups:
                  - platform.kratix.io
                resources:
                  - workplacements
                verbs:
                  - list
              - apiGroups:
                  - platform.kratix.io
                resources:
                  - destinations
                verbs:
                  - list
                resourceNamespace: "*"
            containers:
              - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-tfstate-finder:v0.1.0
                name: fetch-output
                env:
                - name: TIMEOUT
                  value: "30m"
```

The `TIMEOUT` environment variable can be configured to match the amount of
time you expect the Terraform plan and apply to take. The Aspect will keep
trying to fetch the outputs until the timeout is reached.

If `TIMEOUT` is not set, the default timeout is 5 minutes.

The Pipeline has a set of additional `rbac.permisisons` set. It requires these
to successfully fetch the outputs from TFE. They are used for:

- Listing WorkPlacements to find the Destination associated with the Resource
- Listing Destinations to find the credentials needed to access TFE
- Getting the Secret with the TFE credentials

:::info

The `ske-tfstate-finder` image is hosted in a private registry. To access the
image, you will need to use the access token provided by Syntasso and your
Kubernetes cluster must have the permissions to pull images from the registry.

You can also set `imagePullSecrets` in the [Pipeline
spec](/main/reference/workflows#pipelines).

:::

### Writing Resource-specific outputs to the Resource Status

By default, the Aspect will add the Terraform outputs from any `.tf` files in the
Resource's scheduled workloads to the Resource's `status.outputs`. For example, in the
`spec.resource.configure` workflow above, and assuming the name `my-resource` in the
default namespace, the following would be added to the Resource status:

```yaml
outputs:
  tfe: # Destination name
    my-resource-default-resource-configure: "some-value" # TFE output name/value
```

If you want to customise what gets persisted to the status, you can skip this step by
setting the `SKIP_STATUS` environment variable in the Aspect's container to `"true"`.
In this case, the `*-tfoutput.yaml` files in `/kratix/metadata` will still be written, so
that you can access the outputs in the Pipeline.

### Accessing outputs in the Pipeline

The Aspect will also write a set of `*-tfoutput.yaml` files to
`/kratix/metadata` containing all of the Terraform workspace outputs present at the time
the Resource or Promise workloads were written to the State Store.

To ensure uniqueness, the naming convention for the output files is
`<destinationName>-<commitSha>-tfoutput.yaml`, where `destinationName` is the name of the
Terraform Destination from which the outputs were read, and `commitSha` is the SHA of the
commit in which the workloads were written to the State Store.

In the most common case, the `.tf` files are scheduled to a single Terraform Destination
in a single previous Pipeline (as in the example above). When this is the case, you can
find the output file within the Pipeline as follows:

```
file=$(find /kratix/metadata -type f -name '*-tfoutput.yaml' | head -n 1)
```

If there were multiple files, you could narrow your search by Destination name:

```
file=$(find /kratix/metadata -type f -name '<destinationName>*-tfoutput.yaml' | head -n 1)
```

The output files will look similar to the following:

```yaml
- id: wsout-usr3cvFTLCepr4CL
  name: promise-configure
  sensitive: false
  type: string
  value: some-value
  detailedtype: string
- id: wsout-YbSiFpvauuVTeQbV
  name: resource-configure
  sensitive: false
  type: string
  value: some-value
  detailedtype: string
- id: wsout-AIGhavgdsiHVnaHP
  name: other-output
  sensitive: false
  type: string
  value: some-value
  detailedtype: string
```

<summary>Example: Accessing an output and writing it to a custom Resource status field</summary>

                    file=$(find /kratix/metadata -type f -name '*-tfoutput.yaml' | head -n 1)
                    value=$(yq e '.[] | select(.name == "promise-configure") | .value' "${file}")
                    echo "customStatusField: ${value}" >> /kratix/metadata/status.yaml
# highlight-end
```

This example uses the `kratix-pipeline-utility` image, which comes with `yq` pre-installed.
It also assumes a single output file for simplicity.
