If you have the Backstage Controller installed, you can configure your Promises to automatically generate
Backstage components and templates. To do that, ensure your Promises are labelled with `kratix.io/backstage: true`.

You can label the Promise via `kubectl`:

```yaml
kubectl label promises REPLACEWITH_PROMISE_NAME kratix.io/backstage=true
```

## Customize Backstage Component

You can customize the automatically generated Backstage Components by creating a cluster-wide `BackstageEntityCustomization`:

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: BackstageEntityCustomization
metadata:
  name: my-customization
spec:
  destinationSelectors: # optional
  - matchLabels:
      environment: backstage
  containers: # optional
    - name: add-backstage-group
      image: ghcr.io/syntasso/run-customization:v0.0.1
```

The containers defined in the customization will run after `ske-backstage-generator`.
It can modify existing `catalog-info.yaml` file from `ske-backstage-generator` or it could generate new files.
This customization will apply to all Promises with label `kratix.io/backstage: true`.

Destination selectors defined in the customization will apply to all generated Backstage components.
You can use it to make sure that generated components are only scheduled to your Backstage destinations.
