:::warning Deprecated

The SKE Backstage Component Promise is now deprecated and its documentation will be removed soon. 

The functionality it provides is now available by default with v0.14.0 version
of the Backstage Plugins and SKE version 0.21.0.

:::



The SKE Backstage Component Promise provides additional functionality to the SKE
Backstage integration by offloading management of Backstage Components and
Templates files from your Promises. The Promise enables the following features:

- Allow updates to the Backstage Component and Templates while a Pipeline is still running.
- Enables the combination of multiple Backstage Components and Templates into a single
  `catalog-info.yaml` file. For some Backstage integrations, such as GitLab,
  this is a requirement.

You can install the Promise via `kubectl`:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f https://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/promises/ske-backstage-component-promise.yaml
```

## Component updates with multiple Pipelines

If your Promise or Resource workflow contains multiple Pipelines, you may wish to update
the associated Component in Backstage at the end of each Pipeline. For example, the
Resource status could be updated in every Pipeline to convey the latest information about
the Resource to the requester in Backstage.

To do this, run the SKE Backstage Generator as normal, then create a
request to the SKE Backstage Component Promise within the next pipeline container. In this example the image
`ghcr.io/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/create-backstage-component-request:v0.1.0` is responsible for generating a SKE
Backstage Component Promise request:

```yaml
  # ...
  workflows:
    resource:
      configure:
      - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
        kind: Pipeline
        metadata:
          name: resource-configure
          namespace: default
        spec:
          #highlight-start
          # rbac required by new create-backstage-component-request image
          rbac:
            permissions:
              - apiGroups: ["syntasso.io"]
                verbs: ["*"]
                resources: ["backstagecomponents"]
          #highlight-end
          containers:

            name: jenkins-resource-pipeline
          - image: registry.syntasso.io/syntasso/ske-backstage-generator:VERSION
            name: ske-backstage-generator

            name: create-backstage-component-request
          #highlight-end
    promise:
      configure:
      - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
        kind: Pipeline
        metadata:
          name: promise-configure
          namespace: default
        spec:
          #highlight-start
          rbac:
            permissions:
              - apiGroups: ["syntasso.io"]
                verbs: ["*"]
                resources: ["backstagecomponents"]
          #highlight-end
          containers:
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/jenkins-configure-pipeline:v0.1.0
            name: jenkins-promise-pipeline
          - image: registry.syntasso.io/syntasso/ske-backstage-generator:VERSION
            name: ske-backstage-generator
          #highlight-start
          - image:  ghcr.io/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/create-backstage-component-request:v0.1.0
            name: create-backstage-component-request
          #highlight-end
```

:::note
The versions of the `ske-backstage-generator` image used in your Promise specification and
the `ske-backstage-generator` image in the SKE Backstage Component Promise must match

### Requesting Backstage Components

When creating the `BackstageComponent` requests you need to ensure that you set the
correct `.metadata.ownerReferences` on the resource to ensure it is deleted when the
resource/promise is deleted. An example of this is shown below:

```yaml
apiVersion: syntasso.io/v1alpha1
kind: BackstageComponent
metadata:
  name: <unique-name>
  namespace: <same namespace as the request (kratix-platform-system for promises)>
  ownerReferences:
  - apiVersion: <apiVersion of the parent object>
    blockOwnerDeletion: false
    controller: false
    kind: <kind of the parent object>
    name: <name of the parent object>
    uid: <uid of the parent object>
spec:
- resources: |
  ... # contents of /kratix/output/backstage/catalog-info.yaml
```

The `name` `apiVersion`, `kind` and `uid` fields under `ownerReferences` must equal
the parent object for this request, which is the `/kratix/input/object.yaml`.

The `spec.resources` needs to be a string containing the Backstage Component/Template
YAML files.

Running in this mode, the SKE Backstage Generator will not schedule the Backstage
documents itself. Instead, it will delegate this responsibility to the SKE Backstage
Component Promise.

This allows the Backstage Component document to be managed per-Resource, meaning Resource
metadata such as the status can be updated across multiple Pipelines.

After creating the `BackstageComponent` request, you need to ensure your
pipeline does not also schedule the same document to the Backstage Destination.
To prevent this you can `rm -rf /kratix/output/backstage` and remove the
`dir: backstage` entry in your `/kratix/metadata/destination-selectors.yaml` after
making the request.

                    export name="$(yq eval '.metadata.name' /kratix/input/object.yaml)"
                    export namespace="$(yq eval '.metadata.namespace' /kratix/input/object.yaml)"
                    export promise_name=$KRATIX_PROMISE_NAME

                    kind=$(yq eval '.kind' /kratix/input/object.yaml)
                    api_version=$(yq eval '.apiVersion' /kratix/input/object.yaml)
                    uid=$(yq eval '.metadata.uid' /kratix/input/object.yaml)
                    concatenated_string="${promise_name}-${namespace}-${name}"
                    hash=$(echo -n "$concatenated_string" | sha256sum | cut -c1-5)
                    truncated_string=$(echo -n "$concatenated_string" | cut -c1-50)
                    deterministic_name="${truncated_string}-${hash}"

                    cd /kratix/output/

                    kind: BackstageComponent
                    metadata:
                      name: $deterministic_name
                      namespace: $namespace
                      ownerReferences:

                        blockOwnerDeletion: false

                        uid: $uid
                    spec: {}
                    EOF

                    # set .spec.resources equal to file contents of catalog-info.yaml
                    yq eval '.spec.resources = strload("backstage/catalog-info.yaml")' -i rr.yaml
                    kubectl apply -f rr.yaml
                    rm -rf /kratix/output/rr.yaml /kratix/output/backstage/ /kratix/metadata/destination-selectors.yaml
```

### Scheduling Backstage Components

By default, `BackstageComponent` requests are scheduled to your Backstage destination.
If you need to schedule a `BackstageComponent` to a destination other than
the default Backstage destination with label `environment: backstage`, you can set the
`.spec.destinationSelectors` on the resource to customize its scheduling behavior.
An example of this is shown below:

```yaml
apiVersion: syntasso.io/v1alpha1
kind: BackstageComponent
metadata:
  name: A-NAME
  namespace: NAMESPACE
spec:
  destinationSelectors:
  - matchLabels:
      environment: backstage-instance-one
      team: billing
- resources: |
  ... # contents of /kratix/output/backstage/catalog-info.yaml
```

## Generate a single Backstage catalog

Using the SKE Backstage Component Promise, you can optionally choose to write a single
`catalog-info.yaml` file for Backstage to read from, instead of the default behaviour of
one catalog file per Promise or resource request.

To do this, there are two steps required:
- Configuring the SKE Backstage Generator to write all of the Backstage manifests in a
single `catalog-info.yaml`.
- Configuring all of your Promises to use the SKE Backstage Component Promise.

First, apply the following config map to your Platform cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  allInOne: "true"
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: ske-backstage-component-promise-config
  namespace: kratix-platform-system
```

Then configure all of your Promises which use the SKE Backstage Generator to make a request
to the SKE Backstage Component Promise within your Pipeline, as illustrated in the [section
above](#component-updates-with-multiple-pipelines).

:::info

To ensure that a single `catalog-info.yaml` file is created, you must ensure that **all**
of your Promises which use the SKE Backstage Generator are set up to make a request
to the SKE Backstage Component Promise in **both** the Promise and Resource workflows.

:::

Configuring the `allInOne` field to `true` will cause the SKE Backstage Component Promise
to aggregate the Backstage Component and Template files for all Promises and Resources
into a single `catalog-info.yaml` file in the Backstage Destination.

With these changes, your SKE Backstage integration will result in a single
`catalog-info.yaml` file being written to your Backstage Destination containing all of the
generated Component and Template manifests.
