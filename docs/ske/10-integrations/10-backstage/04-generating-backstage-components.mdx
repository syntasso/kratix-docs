The Backstage Controller generates Backstage components and templates for Promises and Resource Requests.

## Prerequisites

### Authenticating against the image registry

Both the Backstage Controller image and the SKE Backstage Generator image used by the Controller are hosted in a private registry, to access
these images when Deploying and using the Backstage Controller deployment, you will need to authenticate using the token you have been provided with.
You can define your authentication credentials via a `docker-registry` secret named `syntasso-registry`:

```yaml
kubectl create secret docker-registry syntasso-registry \
  --docker-server=registry.syntasso.io \
  --docker-username=syntasso-pkg \
  --docker-password=YOUR_TOKEN \
  --namespace kratix-platform-system
```

The above command creates a Kubernetes Secret in namespace `kratix-platform-system`.
For any resource requests created in other namespaces, you need to create the same registry secret in them as well.

### SKE Backstage plugins

The generated Backstage Templates reference an action from the `ske-backend` Backstage plugin, this action is
used to create a Resource Request.
The generated Components are also used by the `ske-frontend` Backstage plugin to display
Promise and Resource metadata.

In order to utilise the Templates and Components, you should also install both the
`ske-backend` and `ske-frontend` plugins into your Backstage instance.

See [Configuring the Plugins](./plugins) for installation instructions.

### Backstage Destination {#destination}

You must have a Destination created with the `environment: backstage` label. See the
[Kratix Backstage docs](./configuring-backstage#configure-a-destination-for-backstage)
for setup instructions.

:::warning

You will need SKE `0.28.0` or later for Backstage Controller to work.

## Installing the Backstage Controller

The Controller is released separately from SKE. Its releases can be found [here](../../releases/backstage-controller).

You can apply the Controller by installing the distribution at the desired version:

```bash
kubectl apply -f http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/#backstage-controller/<VERSION>/backstage-controller.yaml
```

## How does it work?

The SKE Backstage Controller creates a Workflow that automatically generates the Backstage components and
templates for your Promise. This Workflow runs in addition to the Configure Workflow for your Promises and Requests.

### Promise Configure

In a Promise Configure workflow, two Backstage manifests will be generated:

- **Promise Component:** A Backstage Component representing the Promise.
- **Promise Template:** A Backstage Template representing the Promise API (i.e. the CRD
  for Resources created from this Promise).

### Resource Configure

In a Resource Configure workflow, a single Backstage manifest will be generated:

- **Resource Component:** A Backstage Component representing the Resource.

Check the [YAML File Format](./yaml-file-format) for examples of these manifests

### Labelling Promises for automatic file generation

To generate Backstage Components and Template for your Promise, as well as Components for requests for that Promise,
label your Promise with `kratix.io/backstage: true`.

```bash
kubectl label promises PROMISE_NAME kratix.io/backstage=true
```

Or add the label to the Promise spec:

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: Promise
metadata:
  name: my-promise
  labels:
    kratix.io/backstage: "true"
```

## Customize Backstage Components

You can customize the automatically generated Backstage Components and Templates by creating a cluster-wide 
`BackstageEntityCustomization`:

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: BackstageEntityCustomization
metadata:
  name: my-customization
spec:
  destinationSelectors: # optional
  - matchLabels:
      environment: backstage
  containers: # optional
    - name: add-backstage-group
      image: ghcr.io/syntasso/run-customization:v0.0.1
```

### Custom containers

The containers defined in the customization will run after the `backstage-gen` container which generates the
Components and Templates. They can be used to modify the existing `catalog-info.yaml` file created by the
`ske-backstage-generator` or it can generate new files. This customization will apply to all Promises with label
`kratix.io/backstage: true` as well as Resource Requests for these promises.

If you want to edit the `catalog.info` or generate different files based on whether the Workflow is running for a
Promise or Resource Request, the container can query the `KRATIX_WORKFLOW_TYPE` environment variable.
For Promises, this is equal to `promise-backstage-gen` and for resources, `resource-backstage-gen`.

### Destination Selectors

By default, Destination selectors defined in the customization will apply to all generated Backstage components.
You can use these to make sure that generated components are only scheduled to your Backstage destinations.
