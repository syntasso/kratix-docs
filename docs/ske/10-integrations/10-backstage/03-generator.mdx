The SKE Backstage Generator provides automated generation of the necessary Template and
Component manifests for your Promises and requested Resources.

These manifests are read by Backstage and are designed to work seamlessly with the
SKE Backstage plugins.

## Prerequisites

### SKE Backstage plugins

The `ske-backstage-generator` uses an action from the `ske-backend` Backstage plugin.
This action is used within the generated Template to create a Resource Request.
The generated Components are also used by the `ske-frontend` Backstage plugin to display
Promise and Resource metadata.

In order to utilise the Templates and Components, you should also install both the
`ske-backend` and `ske-frontend` plugins into your Backstage instance.

See [Configuring the Plugins](./plugins) for instructions.

### Backstage Destination {#destination}

You must have a Destination created with the `environment: backstage` label. See the
[Kratix Backstage docs](./configuring-backstage#configure-a-destination-for-backstage)
for setup instructions.

## How does it work?

The `ske-backstage-generator` image is intended to be run as part of your
Configure Pipeline for your Promise and Resource Workflows. It will
auto-generate Backstage Template and Component manifests, and schedule them to
your [Backstage Destination](#destination).

### Promise Configure

In a Promise Configure workflow, two Backstage manifests will be generated:

- **Promise Component:** A Backstage Component representing the Promise.
- **Promise Template:** A Backstage Template representing the Promise API (i.e. the CRD
  for Resources created from this Promise).

Check the [YAML File Format](./yaml-file-format) for examples of these manifests.

### Resource Configure

In a Resource Configure workflow, a single Backstage manifest will be generated:

- **Resource Component:** A Backstage Component representing the Resource.

Check the [YAML File Format](./yaml-file-format) for examples of these manifests.

## Accessing the SKE Generator image

### Pulling the image locally

The image is hosted in a private registry. To access the image, you will need to
authenticate using the token you have been provided with. For Docker, you can
run the following command, providing your token as the password when prompted:

```bash
docker login ghcr.io --username syntasso-pkg
```

If you are using a different container engine, follow the docs for your specific
tool.

Once you have authenticated, you should be able to pull the image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-backstage-generator:v0.3.0
```

### Pulling the image from your cluster

Your Kubernetes cluster must have permission to [pull this image from the
private
registry](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#configuring-nodes-to-authenticate-to-a-private-registry).

If you are following the [quick-start guide](/main/quick-start), you can load the image
directly to the Kubernetes cache. Different tools have different commands for this. For example:

```bash
# For minikube
minikube image load ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-backstage-generator:v0.3.0

# For KinD
kind load docker-image ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-backstage-generator:v0.3.0
```

For other tools, follow their specific documentation.

When using the image in your Workflows, you can define the secret you want to use for authentication within your Promise, see below for more details.

:::info

If your cluster is running in a secure environment, you may wish to pull this image and
push it to an internal registry which your cluster has permission to pull from.

:::

## Using the image in your Workflows

To use the `ske-backstage-generator` image, update your Promise definition to include the
generator as a workflow step for both the Promise Configure and Resource Configure
workflows:

```yaml title="Workflows section in a Promise file"
  # ...
  workflows:
    promise:
      configure:
      - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
        kind: Pipeline
        metadata:
          name: promise-configure
          namespace: default
        spec:
          containers:
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/jenkins-configure-pipeline:v0.1.0
            name: jenkins-promise-pipeline
          #highlight-start
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-backstage-generator:v0.3.0
            name: ske-backstage-generator
          #highlight-end
    resource:
      configure:
      - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
        kind: Pipeline
        metadata:
          name: resource-configure
          namespace: default
        spec:
          containers:
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/jenkins-configure-pipeline:v0.1.0
            name: jenkins-resource-pipeline
          #highlight-start
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-backstage-generator:v0.3.0
            name: ske-backstage-generator
          #highlight-end
```

Once your Promise is updated, the generator will be run as part of your
Workflows. If you install the Promise, you should see a Component automatically
appearing in your Backstage instance, together with a new Template. If you use
the Template to create a Resource, you should see the resource Component
appearing as well as the Resource itself being created in your cluster.

In order to have the full status of your Promise or Resource request displayed in Backstage,
you should place the aspect as the last image in the last pipeline of your workflow.

If the aspect needs to be used more than once in a Workflow, you should utilise the [SKE Backstage
Component Promise](#ske-backstage-component-promise). Otherwise, you will observe only one of the components
in Backstage, and Backstage will emit a warning:

```
{"level":"warn","message":"Detected conflicting entityRef component:default/my-request-jenkins already referenced by url:http://minio.kratix-platform-system.svc.cluster.local/kratix/backstage/resources/default/cicd/my-request/instance-configure/5cfaf/backstage/catalog-info.yaml and now also url:http://minio.kratix-platform-system.svc.cluster.local/kratix/backstage/resources/default/cicd/my-request/instance-configure-2/5cfaf/backstage/catalog-info.yaml","plugin":"catalog","service":"backstage"}
```

### Authenticating against the image registry

If you have not loaded the image to your Kubernetes cache or pushed it to an internal registry,
you can define your authentication credentials via a `docker-registry` secret and refer to this secret
in Pipeline definition in your Workflow.

You can create the secret with the following command, replacing `YOUR_TOKEN` with the token you have
been provided with:

```yaml
kubectl create secret docker-registry syntasso-registry \
  --docker-server=ghcr.io \
  --docker-username=syntasso-pkg \
  --docker-password=YOUR_TOKEN \
  --namespace kratix-platform-system
```

:::info

The secret must exist in the `kratix-platform-system` namespace as well as any other namespaces where users
be able to make requests

:::

The `imagePullSecrets` field in your Workflow can be used to refer to the new `syntasso-registry`
secret.

```yaml
  # ...
  workflows:
    promise:
      configure:
      - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
        kind: Pipeline
        metadata:
          name: promise-configure
          namespace: default
        spec:
          #highlight-start
          imagePullSecrets:
            - name: syntasso-registry
          #highlight-end
          containers:
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/jenkins-configure-pipeline:v0.1.0
            name: jenkins-promise-pipeline
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-backstage-generator:v0.3.0
            name: ske-backstage-generator
```

This ensures that, when pulling the `ske-backstage-generator` image, Kubernetes will use the
`syntasso-registry` secrets for authentication.

## Customising the generated Components

By default, the generator will create the Backstage Promise `Component` with default values for the `metadata` and
`spec` fields. For a Promise, for example, it will look like this:

```yaml
metadata:
  name: <Promise Kind>-promise
  title: <Promise Kind> Promise
  description: <Promise Kind> as a Service
  tags:
    - kratix
spec:
  lifecycle: production
  owner: kratix-platform
  type: kratix-promise
  # Other fields are left empty
```
You can customise these values by setting the following `env` variables in the
workflow:

* `COMPONENT_NAME`: the value of `metadata.name`
* `COMPONENT_TITLE`: the value of `metadata.title`
* `COMPONENT_DESCRIPTION`: the value of `metadata.description`
* `COMPONENT_TAGS`: comma-separated list of values for `metadata.tags`
* `COMPONENT_TYPE`: the value of `spec.type`
* `COMPONENT_LIFECYCLE`: the value of `spec.lifecycle`
* `COMPONENT_OWNER`: the value of `spec.owner`
* `COMPONENT_SYSTEM`: the value of `spec.system`
* `COMPONENT_SUBCOMPONENT_OF`: the value of `spec.subcomponentOf`
* `COMPONENT_PROVIDES_APIS`: comma-separated list of values for `spec.providesApis`
* `COMPONENT_CONSUMES_APIS`: comma-separated list of values for `spec.consumesApis`
* `COMPONENT_DEPENDS_ON`: comma-separated list of values for `spec.dependsOn`

You can also customise the fields by setting the following annotations in the Promise or Resource object directly:

* `ske.backstage.component/name`: the value of `metadata.name`
* `ske.backstage.component/title`: the value of `metadata.title`
* `ske.backstage.component/description`: the value of `metadata.description`
* `ske.backstage.component/tags`: comma-separated list of values for `metadata.tags`
* `ske.backstage.component/type`: the value of `spec.type`
* `ske.backstage.component/lifecycle`: the value of `spec.lifecycle`
* `ske.backstage.component/owner`: the value of `spec.owner`
* `ske.backstage.component/system`: the value of `spec.system`
* `ske.backstage.component/subcomponentOf`: the value of `spec.subcomponentOf`
* `ske.backstage.component/providesApis`: comma-separated list of values for `spec.providesApis`
* `ske.backstage.component/consumesApis`: comma-separated list of values for `spec.consumesApis`
* `ske.backstage.component/dependsOn`: comma-separated list of values for `spec.dependsOn`

For example, to set `spec.owner` and `spec.providesApis`, you can update your
pipeline stage with the snippet below:

```yaml title="Promise workflow with custom Component values"
  #...
  workflows:
    promise:
      configure:
      - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
        kind: Pipeline
        metadata:
          name: promise-configure
          namespace: default
        spec:
          containers:
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/jenkins-configure-pipeline:v0.1.0
            name: jenkins-promise-pipeline
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-backstage-generator:v0.3.0
            name: ske-backstage-generator
            #highlight-start
            env:
            - name: COMPONENT_OWNER
              value: "platform-team"
            - name: COMPONENT_PROVIDES_APIS
              value: "component/api/v1,component/api/v2"
            #highlight-end
```

## Customising the generated Templates

By default, the generator will create the Backstage Template with resource namespace as a required field.
You can customise this behaviour by setting the following `env` variables in the workflow:

* `TEMPLATE_NAMESPACE`: the default value of the resource namespace
* `TEMPLATE_NAMESPACE_FIELD_TITLE`: the name of the resource namespace field in Backstage UI
* `TEMPLATE_NAMESPACE_FIELD_DESCRIPTION`: the description of the resource namespace field in Backstage UI
* `TEMPLATE_HIDE_NAMESPACE`: set to `true` if you would like to hide the namespace field from the generated resource
Template.
Resource namespace will default to `TEMPLATE_NAMESPACE` when it is set, otherwise will be set to `default` namespace.

For example, to generate the resource Template without the namespace field and set the resource namespace to `my-team`
for all resource requests:

```yaml title="Promise workflow with custom Template values"
  #...
  workflows:
    promise:
      configure:
      - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
        kind: Pipeline
        metadata:
          name: promise-configure
          namespace: default
        spec:
          containers:
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/jenkins-configure-pipeline:v0.1.0
            name: jenkins-promise-pipeline
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-backstage-generator:v0.3.0
            name: ske-backstage-generator
            #highlight-start
            env:
            - name: TEMPLATE_NAMESPACE
              value: "my-team"
            - name: TEMPLATE_HIDE_NAMESPACE
              value: "true"
            #highlight-end
```

## Providing a Resource Summary

On the Resource Component page, it's possible to include a free-form text block
to provide documentation about the resource.

To do this, set the `ske.backstage.component/summary` annotation on the Promise object:

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: Promise
metadata:
  #...
  annotations:
    ske.backstage.component/summary: |
      Some information about this Promise.

      This accepts **markdown!**
```

The text will be rendered on each Resource Component page in Backstage.

## SKE Backstage Component Promise

The SKE Backstage Component Promise provides additional functionality to the SKE Backstage
integration by offloading management of Backstage Components and Templates from your
Promises.

You can install the Promise via `kubectl`:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f https://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/promises/ske-backstage-component-promise.yaml
```

### Component updates with multiple Pipelines

If your Promise or Resource workflow contains multiple Pipelines, you may wish to update
the associated Component in Backstage at the end of each Pipeline. For example, the
Resource status could be updated in every Pipeline to convey the latest information about
the Resource to the requester in Backstage.

To do this, configure the SKE Backstage Generator to send a request to the SKE Backstage
Component Promise in the Promise and Resource workflows by adding `--make-request` to the
SKE Backstage Generator in every Pipeline in your Resource Configure workflow, along with
the `rbac` permissions required by the image:

```yaml
  # ...
  workflows:
    resource:
      configure:
      - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
        kind: Pipeline
        metadata:
          name: resource-configure
          namespace: default
        spec:
          #highlight-start
          rbac:
            permissions:
              - apiGroups: ["syntasso.io"]
                verbs: ["*"]
                resources: ["backstagecomponents"]
          #highlight-end
          containers:
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/jenkins-configure-pipeline:v0.1.0
            name: jenkins-resource-pipeline
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-backstage-generator:v0.7.0
            name: ske-backstage-generator
          #highlight-start
            args:
            - --make-request
          #highlight-end
    promise:
      configure:
      - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
        kind: Pipeline
        metadata:
          name: promise-configure
          namespace: default
        spec:
          #highlight-start
          rbac:
            permissions:
              - apiGroups: ["syntasso.io"]
                verbs: ["*"]
                resources: ["backstagecomponents"]
          #highlight-end
          containers:
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/jenkins-configure-pipeline:v0.1.0
            name: jenkins-promise-pipeline
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-backstage-generator:v0.7.0
            name: ske-backstage-generator
          #highlight-start
            args:
            - --make-request
          #highlight-end
```

Running in this mode, the SKE Backstage Generator will not schedule the Backstage
documents itself. Instead, it will delegate this responsibility to the SKE Backstage
Component Promise.

This allows the Backstage Component document to be managed per-Resource, meaning Resource
metadata such as the status can be updated across multiple Pipelines.

### Generate a single Backstage catalog

Using the SKE Backstage Component Promise, you can optionally choose to write a single
`catalog-info.yaml` file for Backstage to read from, instead of the default behaviour of
one catalog file per Promise or resource request.

To do this, there are two steps required:
- Configuring the SKE Backstage Generator to write all of the Backstage manifests in a
single `catalog-info.yaml`.
- Configuring all of your Promises to use the SKE Backstage Component Promise.

First, apply the following config map to your Platform cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  allInOne: "true"
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: ske-backstage-component-promise-config
  namespace: kratix-platform-system
```

Then configure all of your Promises which use the SKE Backstage Generator to use the
`--make-request` option in the Pipeline, as illustrated in the [section
above](#component-updates-with-multiple-pipelines).

:::info

To ensure that a single `catalog-info.yaml` file is created, you must ensure that **all**
of your Promises which use the SKE Backstage Generator are set up to use the
`--make-request` option in **both** the Promise and Resource workflows.

:::

Configuring the `allInOne` field to `true` will cause the SKE Backstage Component Promise
to aggregate the Backstage Component and Template files for all Promises and Resources
into a single `catalog-info.yaml` file in the Backstage Destination.

With these changes, your SKE Backstage integration will result in a single
`catalog-info.yaml` file being written to your Backstage Destination containing all of the
generated Component and Template manifests.
