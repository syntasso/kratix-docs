The SKE Backstage Generator provides automated generation of the necessary Template and
Component manifests for your Promises and requested Resources.

These manifests are read by Backstage and are designed to work seamlessly with the
SKE Backstage plugins.

## Prerequisites

### SKE Backstage plugins

The `ske-backstage-generator` uses an action from the `ske-backend` Backstage plugin.
This action is used within the generated Template to create a Resource Request.
The generated Components are also used by the `ske-frontend` Backstage plugin to display
Promise and Resource metadata.

In order to utilise the Templates and Components, you should also install both the
`ske-backend` and `ske-frontend` plugins into your Backstage instance.

See [Configuring the Plugins](./plugins) for instructions.

### Backstage Destination {#destination}

You must have a Destination created with the `environment: backstage` label. See the
[Kratix Backstage docs](./configuring-backstage#configure-a-destination-for-backstage)
for setup instructions.

## How does it work?

The `ske-backstage-generator` image is intended to be run as part of your Configure
Pipeline for your Promise and Resource Workflows. It will auto-generate Backstage Template
and Component manifests, and schedule them to your [Backstage Destination](#destination).

### Promise Configure

In a Promise Configure workflow, two Backstage manifests will be generated:

- **Promise Component:** A Backstage Component representing the Promise.
- **Promise Template:** A Backstage Template representing the Promise API (i.e. the CRD
  for Resources created from this Promise).

Check the [YAML File Format](./yaml-file-format) for examples of these manifests.

### Resource Configure

In a Resource Configure workflow, a single Backstage manifest will be generated:

- **Resource Component:** A Backstage Component representing the Resource.

Check the [YAML File Format](./yaml-file-format) for examples of these manifests.

## Accessing the SKE Generator image

### Pulling the image locally

The image is hosted in a private registry. To access the image, you will need to
authenticate using the token you have been provided with. For Docker, you can
run the following command, providing your token as the password when prompted:

```bash
docker login ghcr.io --username syntasso-pkg
```

If you are using a different container engine, follow the docs for your specific
tool.

Once you have authenticated, you should be able to pull the image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-backstage-generator:v0.3.0
```

### Pulling the image from your cluster

Your Kubernetes cluster must have permission to [pull this image from the
private
registry](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#configuring-nodes-to-authenticate-to-a-private-registry).

If you are following the [quick-start guide](/main/quick-start), you can load the image
directly to the Kubernetes cache. Different tools have different commands for this. For example:

```bash
# For minikube
minikube image load ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-backstage-generator:v0.3.0

# For KinD
kind load docker-image ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-backstage-generator:v0.3.0
```

For other tools, follow their specific documentation.

When using the image in your Workflows, you can define the secret you want to use for authentication within your Promise, see below for more details.

:::info

If your cluster is running in a secure environment, you may wish to pull this image and
push it to an internal registry which your cluster has permission to pull from.

:::

## Using the image in your Workflows

To use the `ske-backstage-generator` image, update your Promise definition to include the
generator as a workflow step for both the Promise Configure and Resource Configure
workflows:

```yaml title="Workflows section in a Promise file"
  # ...
  workflows:
    promise:
      configure:
      - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
        kind: Pipeline
        metadata:
          name: promise-configure
          namespace: default
        spec:
          containers:
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/jenkins-configure-pipeline:v0.1.0
            name: jenkins-promise-pipeline
          #highlight-start
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-backstage-generator:v0.3.0
            name: ske-backstage-generator
          #highlight-end
    resource:
      configure:
      - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
        kind: Pipeline
        metadata:
          name: resource-configure
          namespace: default
        spec:
          containers:
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/jenkins-configure-pipeline:v0.1.0
            name: jenkins-resource-pipeline
          #highlight-start
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-backstage-generator:v0.3.0
            name: ske-backstage-generator
          #highlight-end
```

Once your Promise is updated, the generator will be run as part of your
Workflows. If you install the Promise, you should see a Component automatically
appearing in your Backstage instance, together with a new Template. If you use
the Template to create a Resource, you should see the resource Component
appearing as well as the Resource itself being created in your cluster.

### Authenticating against the image registry

If you have not loaded the image to your Kubernetes cache or pushed it to an internal registry,
you can define your authentication credentials via a `docker-registry` secret and refer to this secret
in Pipeline definition in your Workflow.

You can create the secret with the following command, replacing `YOUR_TOKEN` with the token you have
been provided with:

```yaml
kubectl create secret docker-registry syntasso-registry \
  --docker-server=ghcr.io \
  --docker-username=syntasso-pkg \
  --docker-password=YOUR_TOKEN \
  --namespace kratix-platform-system
```

:::info

The secret must exist in the `kratix-platform-system` namespace as well as any other namespaces where users
be able to make requests

:::

The `imagePullSecrets` field in your Workflow can be used to refer to the new `syntasso-registry`
secret.

```yaml
  # ...
  workflows:
    promise:
      configure:
      - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
        kind: Pipeline
        metadata:
          name: promise-configure
          namespace: default
        spec:
          #highlight-start
          imagePullSecrets:
            - name: syntasso-registry
          #highlight-end
          containers:
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/jenkins-configure-pipeline:v0.1.0
            name: jenkins-promise-pipeline
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-backstage-generator:v0.3.0
            name: ske-backstage-generator
```

This ensures that, when pulling the `ske-backstage-generator` image, Kubernetes will use the
`syntasso-registry` secrets for authentication.

## Customising the generated Components

### The Promise Component

By default, the generator will create the Backstage Promise `Component` with the
following `spec`:

```yaml
spec:
  type: kratix-promise
  lifecycle: production
  owner: kratix
```

To customise these values, or to include any additional fields (as defined in the
[Backstage
docs](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/descriptor-format#kind-component))
you can set the following `env` variables in the workflow:

* `COMPONENT_TYPE`: the value of `spec.type`
* `COMPONENT_LIFECYCLE`: the value of `spec.lifecycle`
* `COMPONENT_OWNER`: the value of `spec.owner`
* `COMPONENT_SYSTEM`: the value of `spec.system`
* `COMPONENT_SUBCOMPONENT_OF`: the value of `spec.subcomponentOf`
* `COMPONENT_PROVIDES_APIS`: comma-separated list of values for `spec.providesApis`
* `COMPONENT_CONSUMES_APIS`: comma-separated list of values for `spec.consumesApis`
* `COMPONENT_DEPENDS_ON`: comma-separated list of values for `spec.dependsOn`

For example, to set `spec.owner` and `spec.providesApis`, you can update your
pipeline stage with the snippet below:

```yaml title="Promise workflow with custom Component values"
  #...
  workflows:
    promise:
      configure:
      - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
        kind: Pipeline
        metadata:
          name: promise-configure
          namespace: default
        spec:
          containers:
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/jenkins-configure-pipeline:v0.1.0
            name: jenkins-promise-pipeline
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-backstage-generator:v0.3.0
            name: ske-backstage-generator
            #highlight-start
            env:
            - name: COMPONENT_OWNER
              value: "platform-team"
            - name: COMPONENT_PROVIDES_APIS
              value: "component/api/v1,component/api/v2"
            #highlight-end

```

### The Resource Component

The `Component` for a Resource will have the following `spec`:

```yaml
spec:
  type: kratix-resource
  lifecycle: production
  owner: kratix
```

Similar to the Promise Component, you can customise these values by setting the
same set of `env` variables defined above, but in the Resource Configure workflow.

You can also customise the fields by setting the following annotations in the
Resource object itself:

* `ske.backstage.component/type`: the value of `spec.type`
* `ske.backstage.component/lifecycle`: the value of `spec.lifecycle`
* `ske.backstage.component/owner`: the value of `spec.owner`
* `ske.backstage.component/system`: the value of `spec.system`
* `ske.backstage.component/subcomponentOf`: the value of `spec.subcomponentOf`
* `ske.backstage.component/providesApis`: comma-separated list of values for `spec.providesApis`
* `ske.backstage.component/consumesApis`: comma-separated list of values for `spec.consumesApis`
* `ske.backstage.component/dependsOn`: comma-separated list of values for `spec.dependsOn`

## SKE Backstage Component Promise

The SKE Backstage Component Promise provides additional functionality to the SKE Backstage
integration by offloading management of Backstage Components and Templates from your
Promises.

The Promise can be found in the [Syntasso Enterprise
Releases](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/#promises/),
and installed via `kubectl`:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f ske-backstage-component-promise.yaml
```

### Component updates with multiple Pipelines

If your Resource workflow contains multiple Pipelines, you may wish to update the Resource
Component in Backstage at the end of each Pipeline. For example, the Resource status could
be updated in every Pipeline to convey the latest information about the Resource to the
requester in Backstage.

To do this, you can configure the SKE Backstage Generator to send a request to the SKE
Backstage Component Promise in the Resource workflow by adding the `--make-request` arg to
the SKE Backstage Generator in every Pipeline in your Resource Configure workflow, along
with the `rbac` permissions required by the image:

```yaml
  # ...
  workflows:
    resource:
      configure:
      - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
        kind: Pipeline
        metadata:
          name: resource-configure
          namespace: default
        spec:
          #highlight-start
          rbac:
            permissions:
              - apiGroups: ["syntasso.io"]
                verbs: ["*"]
                resources: ["backstagecomponents"]
          #highlight-end
          containers:
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/jenkins-configure-pipeline:v0.1.0
            name: jenkins-resource-pipeline
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-backstage-generator:v0.3.0
            name: ske-backstage-generator
          #highlight-start
            args:
            - --make-request
          #highlight-end
```

Running in this mode, the SKE Backstage Generator will not directly schedule the Backstage
documents itself. Instead, it will delegate this responsibilty to the SKE Backstage
Component Promise.

This allows the Backstage Component document to be managed per Resource, meaning Resource
metadata such as the status can be updated across multiple Pipelines.

### Generate a single Backstage catalog

Using the SKE Backstage Component Promise, you can optionally choose to write a single
`catalog-info.yaml` file for Backstage to read from, instead of the default behaviour of
one catalog file per Promise or resource request.

To do this, there are two steps required:
- Configuring the SKE Backstage Generator to write all of the Backstage manifests in a
single `catalog-info.yaml`.
- Configuring your Promise to use the SKE Backstage Component Promise.

First, apply the following config map to your Platform cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  allInOne: "true"
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: ske-backstage-component-promise-config
  namespace: kratix-platform-system
```

The `allInOne` field will be read by the SKE Backstage Component Promise, which will then
aggregate the Backstage Component and Template files for all Promises and Resources into
a single `catalog-info.yaml` file in the Backstage Destination.

Next, configure the SKE Backstage Generator to send a request to the SKE Backstage
Component Promise in the Resource and Promise workflows:

```yaml
  # ...
  workflows:
    resource:
      configure:
      - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
        kind: Pipeline
        metadata:
          name: resource-configure
          namespace: default
        spec:
          #highlight-start
          rbac:
            permissions:
              - apiGroups: ["syntasso.io"]
                verbs: ["*"]
                resources: ["backstagecomponents"]
          #highlight-end
          containers:
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/jenkins-configure-pipeline:v0.1.0
            name: jenkins-resource-pipeline
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-backstage-generator:v0.3.0
            name: ske-backstage-generator
          #highlight-start
            args:
            - --make-request
          #highlight-end
    promise:
      configure:
      - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
        kind: Pipeline
        metadata:
          name: promise-configure
          namespace: default
        spec:
          #highlight-start
          rbac:
            permissions:
              - apiGroups: ["syntasso.io"]
                verbs: ["*"]
                resources: ["backstagecomponents"]
          #highlight-end
          containers:
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/jenkins-configure-pipeline:v0.1.0
            name: jenkins-promise-pipeline
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-backstage-generator:v0.3.0
            name: ske-backstage-generator
          #highlight-start
            args:
            - --make-request
          #highlight-end
```

With these changes, your SKE Backstage integration will result in a single
`catalog-info.yaml` file being written to your Backstage Destination containing all of the
generated Component and Template manifests.
