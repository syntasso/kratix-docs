If you have the Backstage Controller installed, you can configure your Promises to automatically generate
Backstage components and templates.

## Prerequisites

### SKE Backstage plugins

The generate Backstage Templates reference an action from the `ske-backend` Backstage plugin, this action is
used to create a Resource Request.
The generated Components are also used by the `ske-frontend` Backstage plugin to display
Promise and Resource metadata.

In order to utilise the Templates and Components, you should also install both the
`ske-backend` and `ske-frontend` plugins into your Backstage instance.

See [Configuring the Plugins](./plugins) for instructions.

### Backstage Destination {#destination}

You must have a Destination created with the `environment: backstage` label. See the
[Kratix Backstage docs](./configuring-backstage#configure-a-destination-for-backstage)
for setup instructions.

## How does it work?

The SKE Backstage Controller creates a Workflow that automatically generates the Backstage components and
templates for your Promise.

### Promise Configure

In a Promise Configure workflow, two Backstage manifests will be generated:

- **Promise Component:** A Backstage Component representing the Promise.
- **Promise Template:** A Backstage Template representing the Promise API (i.e. the CRD
  for Resources created from this Promise).

### Resource Configure

In a Resource Configure workflow, a single Backstage manifest will be generated:

- **Resource Component:** A Backstage Component representing the Resource.

Check the [YAML File Format](./yaml-file-format) for examples of these manifests

### Labelling Promises for automatic file generation

To generate Backstage Components and Template for your Promise, as well as Components for requests for that Promise,
label your Promise with `kratix.io/backstage: true`.

```bash
kubectl label promises PROMISE_NAME kratix.io/backstage=true
```

Or add the label to the Promise spec:

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: Promise
metadata:
  name: my-promise
  labels:
    kratix.io/backstage: "true"
```

## Customize Backstage Components

You can customize the automatically generated Backstage Components and Templates by creating a cluster-wide 
`BackstageEntityCustomization`:

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: BackstageEntityCustomization
metadata:
  name: my-customization
spec:
  destinationSelectors: # optional
  - matchLabels:
      environment: backstage
  containers: # optional
    - name: add-backstage-group
      image: ghcr.io/syntasso/run-customization:v0.0.1
```

The containers defined in the customization will run after the container that generates the Components and Templates.
It can modify the existing `catalog-info.yaml` file from `ske-backstage-generator` or it can generate new files.
This customization will apply to all Promises with label `kratix.io/backstage: true`.

By default, Destination selectors defined in the customization will apply to all generated Backstage components.
You can use it to make sure that generated components are only scheduled to your Backstage destinations.
