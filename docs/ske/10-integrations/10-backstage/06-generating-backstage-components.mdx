If you have the Backstage Controller installed, you can configure your Promises to automatically generate
Backstage components and templates.

## Prerequisites

### SKE Backstage plugins

The generate Backstage Templates reference an action from the `ske-backend` Backstage plugin, this action is
used to create a Resource Request.
The generated Components are also used by the `ske-frontend` Backstage plugin to display
Promise and Resource metadata.

In order to utilise the Templates and Components, you should also install both the
`ske-backend` and `ske-frontend` plugins into your Backstage instance.

See [Configuring the Plugins](./plugins) for instructions.

### Backstage Destination {#destination}

You must have a Destination created with the `environment: backstage` label. See the
[Kratix Backstage docs](./configuring-backstage#configure-a-destination-for-backstage)
for setup instructions.

## How does it work?

The SKE Backstage Controller creates a Workflow that automatically generates the Backstage components and
templates for your Promise. This Workflow runs in addition to the Configure Workflow for your Promises and Requests.

### Promise Configure

In a Promise Configure workflow, two Backstage manifests will be generated:

- **Promise Component:** A Backstage Component representing the Promise.
- **Promise Template:** A Backstage Template representing the Promise API (i.e. the CRD
  for Resources created from this Promise).

### Resource Configure

In a Resource Configure workflow, a single Backstage manifest will be generated:

- **Resource Component:** A Backstage Component representing the Resource.

Check the [YAML File Format](./yaml-file-format) for examples of these manifests

### Labelling Promises for automatic file generation

To generate Backstage Components and Template for your Promise, as well as Components for requests for that Promise,
label your Promise with `kratix.io/backstage: true`.

```bash
kubectl label promises PROMISE_NAME kratix.io/backstage=true
```

Or add the label to the Promise spec:

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: Promise
metadata:
  name: my-promise
  labels:
    kratix.io/backstage: "true"
```

## Customize Backstage Components

You can customize the automatically generated Backstage Components and Templates by creating a cluster-wide 
`BackstageEntityCustomization`:

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: BackstageEntityCustomization
metadata:
  name: my-customization
spec:
  destinationSelectors: # optional
  - matchLabels:
      environment: backstage
  containers: # optional
    - name: add-backstage-group
      image: ghcr.io/syntasso/run-customization:v0.0.1
```

### Custom containers

The containers defined in the customization will run after the `backstage-gen` container which generates the
Components and Templates. They can be used to modify the existing `catalog-info.yaml` file created by the
`ske-backstage-generator` or it can generate new files. This customization will apply to all Promises with label
`kratix.io/backstage: true` as well as Resource Requests for these promises.

If you want to edit the `catalog.info` or generate different files based on whether the Workflow is running for a
Promise or Resource Request, the container can query the `KRATIX_WORKFLOW_TYPE` environment variable.
For Promises, this is equal to `promise-backstage-gen` and for resources, `resource-backstage-gen`.

### Destination Selectors

By default, Destination selectors defined in the customization will apply to all generated Backstage components.
You can use these to make sure that generated components are only scheduled to your Backstage destinations.
