The Backstage Controller generates Backstage components and templates for Promises and Resource Requests.

The Controllers is released separately from SKE. Its releases can be found [here](../../releases/backstage-controller).

## Features

The Backstage Controller will:

* Watch for the creation and update of Promises with the `kratix.io/backstage` label set to `true`
* Create a Workflow to generate a Backstage Component and Template for these Promises
* Create a Workflow to generate a Backstage Component for all Resource Requests of these Promises
* Add any user-specified customizations to these Workflows

## Requirements

### Authenticating against the image registry

Both the Backstage Controller image and the SKE Backstage Generator image used by the Controller are hosted in a private registry, to access
these images when Deploying and using the Backstage Controller deployment, you will need to authenticate using the token you have been provided with.
You can define your authentication credentials via a `docker-registry` secret named `syntasso-registry`:

```yaml
kubectl create secret docker-registry syntasso-registry \
  --docker-server=registry.syntasso.io \
  --docker-username=syntasso-pkg \
  --docker-password=YOUR_TOKEN \
  --namespace kratix-platform-system
```

Alternatively, you can host the image on an internal registry that your cluster has permission to pull from or load the image to your Kubernetes cache.

### Backstage Destination

The generated Backstage Entity files are scheduled to your Backstage destination. As a result, you must have a Destination defined with the label
`environment=backstage`.
