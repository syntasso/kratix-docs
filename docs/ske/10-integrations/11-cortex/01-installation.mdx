To integrate SKE with Cortex, you need to set up your Cortex workspace and install the SKE Cortex
integration in your platform.

This document will cover:

- Create a Cortex token for Kratix
- Configure Cortex Workspace
- Set up GitOps in Kratix platform to discover resource requests coming from Cortex
- Install SKE Cortex integration

## Create a Cortex token for SKE

SKE Cortex integration communicates with Cortex through Cortex API.
Following [Cortex's official documentation](https://docs.cortex.io/configure/settings/api-keys/personal-tokens),
you can create a personal access token to access your Cortex workspace, and you need to provide this token to
SKE Cortex integration at installation.

SKE Cortex integration will use the access token to authenticate. The integration will:

* create, update, and delete Workflows
* create, update, and delete custom Entity Types
* create, update, and delete Entities

Please ensure the token is generated with the right permissions.

## Set up Cortex Workspace

Resource requests created from Cortex will be sent to SKE through GitOps. For any of the resource requests Workflows to
run successfully in Cortex, you will need to set up version control integration in your Cortex workspace.

Follow the [office Cortex documentation](https://docs.cortex.io/ingesting-data-into-cortex/integrations) on integrations.
SKE Cortex integration only supports Github and GitLab integrations at the moment. If you require a different version
control provider, please contact Syntasso.

## Install SKE Cortex integration

TODO: all configuration should be done through helm chart,
please review this page and update it as a whole once we have the chart ready to release.

This integration is released separately from SKE.
Its releases can be found in blah and it can be installed using its or ske-operator helm chart.

Before installing this integration, ensure you have a valid SKE installation in your platform to proceed further.

Provide the Cortex access token that you generated from the previous step to helm chart `values.yaml` file.

Set `cortex-config` config map in `values.yaml` file :

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cortex-config # needs to be this name; should be set by helm chart
  namespace: kratix-platform-system
data:
  branch: main # any branch that exists; default to main
  integrationAlias: cortex # needs to matching an existing integration alias name in workspace
  path: test-sub-dir # any dir, if not set, it will default to `kratix-resource-requests`
  provider: github # github or gitlab; else it errors
  repositoryName: syntasso/cortex-testing # needs to be an existing repo
```
