Headlamp is a easy-to-use UI for viewing and managing Kubernetes resources. With the Headlamp SKE Plugin, you can
view your Kratix Promises and Resources in the Headlamp UI.

This page provides information on how to:

1. [Install SKE GUI](#install)
1. [Displaying Promises](#promises)
1. [Displaying Resources](#resources)
1. [Visualizing Kratix Objects](#map)


## Install SKE GUI {#install}

To install SKE GUI using the Helm chart, start by adding the Syntasso Helm
repository:

```bash
helm repo add syntasso https://syntasso.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

### Configure values

Helm can accept values via the values file. Refer to the examples
below for common configuration options. Any configuration should be placed in a
`values.yaml` file that is then passed in to the `helm install` command.

:::tip

You can see all available configuration in the
[helm chart repository](https://github.com/syntasso/helm-charts/blob/main/ske-gui/values.yaml).

#### The SKE license

To run the GUI, you need a license token. If you've already installed SKE using the ske-operator chart,
you will have a SKE token that you can use for the SKE GUI. There's nothing you need to customize in the values file.

You need to customize the values file if:
1. the Kubernetes Secret containing your SKE token is not called `syntasso-registry`
2. you don't have SKE installed in your environment

In your values file, you can set the `skeLicense` field to the license token provided to you by Syntasso.
You can use an existing Secret for the licence token.

```yaml
skeLicense: LICENSE # provided to you by Syntasso
imageRegistry:
  imagePullSecret: null # when set to null, a secret "syntasso-registry" will be created as part of this chart
  # imagePullSecret: "my-own-secret" # use an existing secret; no need to set skeLicense in this case
```

## Displaying the Promises in Headlamp {#promises}

When you open the Headlamp UI, click on the cluster that you want to view your Kratix Promises and Resources. You
will see the "Kratix" sidebar entry in the left sidebar. When you click on this entry, you will see a list of all
the Kratix Promises.

If you want to create a new Promise, click on the plus icon near to the Promises heading. You can enter the Promise
manifest in the opened YAML editor. Then click on the "Apply" button to create the Promise.
