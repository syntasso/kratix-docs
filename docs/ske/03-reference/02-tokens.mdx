Syntasso Kratix Enterprise (SKE) uses two credentials:

- A GitHub token for accessing private release artifacts
- A registry token for pulling container images from `registry.syntasso.io`

## Enterprise Releases token

Use this token when downloading release assets (for example, the SKE testing plugin) from the private `syntasso/enterprise-releases` GitHub repository.

- **Suggested GitHub scopes:** `repo` and `read:packages` so the token can read private release assets and GitHub Container Registry images that may be referenced by release automation.
- **Recommended environment variable:** `GH_TOKEN`.
- **Usage example:** set `GH_TOKEN` before running `gh release download` commands in the SKE documentation.

## Syntasso registry token

Use this token to authenticate as `syntasso-pkg` when pulling images from the private Syntasso registry (`registry.syntasso.io`).

- **Registry permissions:** token must be allowed to pull images from the registry; no other permissions are required.
- **Recommended environment variable:** `SYNTASSO_TOKEN` (or another registry-specific variable consumed by your tooling).
- **Usage example:**

  ```bash
  docker login registry.syntasso.io \
    --username syntasso-pkg \
    --password "$SYNTASSO_TOKEN"
  ```

Store both tokens securely (for example, in a secret manager or CI/CD secret store) and avoid committing them to source control.
