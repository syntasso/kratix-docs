title: The Parts of a Platform
description: Learn about the parts that make up the SKE Platform

This document walks through the parts you would typically find in a Platform, with all the components that you need to run SKE in a production environment.

Below is a diagram of the parts of a Platform:

Central to the Platform is the Platform Cluster. This is the cluster where Kratix is installed, where all the Promises will be made available, and where the users will send their requests to.

Kratix comes with its own webhooks, so it needs certificates to be configurable. You can provide the certificates yourself, or use cert-manager to generate them. To install cert-manager, follow the instructions in the [cert-manager documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/).

Kratix is usually deployed via the SKE Operator. The SKE Operator provides full lifecycle support for Syntasso Kratix Enterprise (SKE) and is the recommended approach for installing and managing your SKE installation. It is installed in the Platform Cluster, and will manage the installation of Kratix for you. To install the SKE Operator, follow the instructions in the [SKE Operator documentation](/ske/installing-ske/advanced-install).

The SKE Operator can also deploy the Backstage Controller, which is an optional component that can be used to integrate your Platform with Backstage. The Backstage Controller will automatically generate the Backstage entities when Promises or resources are created or updated. To install the Backstage Controller, follow the instructions in the [Backstage Controller documentation](/ske/integrations/backstage/generating-backstage-components#installing-the-backstage-controller). To populate the backstage catalog, SKE uses a Git Repository.


:::tip Multiple Interfaces

The diagram above shows Backstage as a possible interface to the Platform. However, your users may interact via different interfaces, such as a CLI or a web portal. SKE includes integrations with a number of Portals, like [Port](/ske/integrations/port).

To visualise and manage your Platform, SKE comes with an optional GUI that can be deployed in the Platform Cluster. To install the GUI, follow the instructions in the [GUI documentation](/ske/installing-ske/ske-gui).

Still in the Platform Cluster, you will likely want to deploy a GitOps Agent like [FluxCD](https://fluxcd.io/docs/installation/) or [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/). The GitOps Agent is required for [Compound Promises](/main/guides/compound-promises) and for [Health Checks](/ske/guides/healthchecks) to work. To install the GitOps Agent, follow the instructions in the [GitOps Agent documentation](/category/installing-gitops-agent).

Kratix schedules workloads to Destinations, like the Worker Cluster in the diagram above, via a State Store (Git Repository or S3-Compatible). The Worker Cluster watch the State Store for changes, and apply them to the cluster via a GitOps Agent. Each Worker Cluster should have its own GitOps Agent running. 

Finally, in the Worker Cluster, you may want to deploy the SKE Health Check agent, to run the health checks defined in the Promises. To install the Health Check agent, follow the instructions in the [Health Check agent documentation](/ske/installing-ske/ske-health-agent).
