title: SKE Operator
description: Reference for the SKE Operator
---

The SKE Operator provides full lifecycle support for Syntasso Kratix Enterprise (SKE) and is the
recommended approach for installing and managing your SKE installation.

The operator has its own [releases](../releases/ske-operator) and it manages instances of
SKE as defined by a [Kratix Custom Resource](#kratix-crd).

:::info

While SKE is can be installed directly via the [released SKE distribution
manifests](../releases/ske#overview), we **highly recommend** that you use the SKE Operator.

Using the Operator will reduce the workload of maintaining SKE, and all future operational
features will only be available via the Operator.

:::

## Features

The SKE Operator will:

* Install a Kratix instance into your cluster, including dependencies
* Prevent drift of Kratix resources by continuously reconciling them against the declared
[SKE distribution](../releases/ske#overview)
* Validate SKE is in a healthy state before upgrading with pre-upgrade checks
* Roll out an upgrade to the next minor version at the latest patch
* Provide information about the status of the upgrade


## The Kratix CRD {#kratix-crd}

The Kratix CRD is the resource definition corresponding to a Kratix installation. This
resource is managed by the SKE Operator.

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.syntasso.io/v1alpha1
kind: Kratix
metadata:
  name: my-kratix
spec:
  version: vX.Y.Z # The desired version of SKE, can be set to latest
  deploymentConfig:
    resources: # set to customize resource requests&limits for kratix deployment
      # limits and requests must be valid Kubernetes resource quantities
      limits:
        memory: 500Mi
        cpu: 300Mi
      requests:
        memory: 500Mi
        cpu: 300Mi
```

The Kratix resource is the owner of all resources installed as part of the [SKE
distribution](../releases/ske#overview), and ensures that their state always matches the
definition in the distribution manifest.
