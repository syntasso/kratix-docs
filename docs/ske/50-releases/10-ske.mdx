## Release Notes

### [v0.39.0](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/#ske/v0.39.0/) (2025-11-05)

#### Features

* The introduction of OpenTelemetry metrics detailing the scheduling of documents in Kratix.
* The introduction of log levels in the Kratix Controllers. The log levels default to `info` and the desired log level can be configured via the [Kratix Config](/main/reference/kratix-config/config).
* This release introduces the short names `wp` and `dest` for `workPlacements` and `Destinations` respectively.
* Better GitStateStore authentication: Kratix now automatically retries authentication after trimming trailing whitespace from secrets.

#### Fixes

* Improve the OpenTelemetry tracing by only tracing Kratix-related API operations.
* Improve the log levels to ensure messages are logged at the correct level of severity.
* Improve the OpenTelemetry tracing to detail the `kratix.action` within the trace attributes.
* Update WorkPlacements to ensure they are not re-reconciled unnecessarily.

#### Security Fixes

* Updated to include latest security updates including the previously mentioned [vulnerability](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GOLANGORGXCRYPTOSSHAGENT-12668891) associated with an indirect dependency of SKE core.

### [v0.7.0](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/#ske/v0.7.0/) (2024-10-30)

#### Features

* **Breaking Change** - Promise and Resource status condition `PipelineCompleted` is replaced by `ConfigureWorkflowCompleted`
    to reflect success of the entire Configure workflow, rather than success of a single pipeline.
    * You need to migrate usage of `PipelineCompleted` to `ConfigureWorkflowCompleted` after upgrading (e.g. in any automation which watches for this condition).
* Add regular reconciliation for the Promise Configure workflow, rerunning at least every 10 hours.
* Add support for configuring [HTTP authorization for Promise Releases](../../main/03-reference/11-promises/05-releases.md#authenticated-endpoints).

### [v0.6.0](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/#ske/v0.6.0/) (2024-10-01)

#### Features

* **Breaking Change** - Compress the `workload.content` in `Works` and `WorkPlacements` to reduce their size
    * Due to the nature of this change, you may observe errors when existing Works and WorkPlacements are retrieved as they are expected to be
    compressed. To ensure existing `Works` and `WorkPlacements` are compressed as expected, re-run the pipelines for any deployed Promises and
    Resource Requests.
