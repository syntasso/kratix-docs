### [v0.18.0](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/#ske/v0.18.0/) (2025-02-26)

#### Features

* Introduces stricter validation of Promise Workflow Pipelines in the Promise webhook to ensure that
a Job can be successfully generated from the Pipeline definition. Please note that as the validations now ensure
that any specified fields are valid, you may be prevented from applying Promises that you were previously able to
apply.
* Support workload files being written to the root directory of a Destination. For a given Destination, when `spec.filepath.mode` is set to `none` and `spec.path` is not set, all Works scheduled will write to the root directory of this Destination.

#### Known issues

There is a known [Golang CVE](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3487) associated with an indirect dependency of SKE core. SKE is not impacted by the vulnerability. We are waiting for an upstream dependency release to update in the next version.

#### Features

* Add new configuration, `spec.cleanup: none | all`, for Destinations. When set
  to `all`, all files in the State Store for that Destination will be deleted
  when the Destination itself is deleted. `none` is the default behaviour, where
  no files are deleted.

### [v0.7.0](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/#ske/v0.7.0/) (2024-10-30)

#### Features

* **Breaking Change** - Promise and Resource status condition `PipelineCompleted` is replaced by `ConfigureWorkflowCompleted`
    to reflect success of the entire Configure workflow, rather than success of a single pipeline.
    * You need to migrate usage of `PipelineCompleted` to `ConfigureWorkflowCompleted` after upgrading (e.g. in any automation which watches for this condition).
* Add regular reconciliation for the Promise Configure workflow, rerunning at least every 10 hours.
* Add support for configuring [HTTP authorization for Promise Releases](../../main/03-reference/11-promises/05-releases.md#authenticated-endpoints).

### [v0.6.0](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/#ske/v0.6.0/) (2024-10-01)

#### Features

* **Breaking Change** - Compress the `workload.content` in `Works` and `WorkPlacements` to reduce their size
    * Due to the nature of this change, you may observe errors when existing Works and WorkPlacements are retrieved as they are expected to be
    compressed. To ensure existing `Works` and `WorkPlacements` are compressed as expected, re-run the pipelines for any deployed Promises and
    Resource Requests.
