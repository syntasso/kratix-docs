## Overview

The Hashicorp Terraform State Finder Pipeline Stage is responsible for finding the
Terraform state of a given resource. It is used to find the Terraform state of a
given resource and write it to the status of the object.

The Pipeline Stage is available as a Container image at:

```
ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-tfstate-finder:VERSION
```

Check the release notes below for information on each available version.

:::important
Please note that as of v0.8.0, the tf-state-finder image will be accessible at ghcr.io not registry.syntasso.io.

Please ensure that your Syntasso Registry secret is updated to reflect this. If it is not updated, any Promises using the tf-state-finder
will fail to pull the image within their Workflows
