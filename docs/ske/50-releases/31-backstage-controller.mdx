## Release Notes

### [v0.1.2](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/#backstage-controller/v0.1.2/) (2025-06-05)

#### Fix

* `syntasso-registry` secret, containing a token that can access syntasso image registry, is required in namespaces that the backstage controller workflows run.
This is so that users' environments can pull the ske-backstage-generator image automatically instead of manually loading the image to their environment.

### [v0.1.1](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/#backstage-controller/v0.1.1/) (2025-05-28)

#### Features

* Initial release
