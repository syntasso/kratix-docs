## Release Notes


### [v0.2.0](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/#backstage-controller/v0.2.0/) (2025-07-16)

#### Features

* Introduce `entityGenerationOptions` to the `BackstageEntityCustomization`
  resource. See [Backstage Entity Customization](/ske/integrations/backstage/generating-backstage-components#customize-backstage-components) for more details.
* Promises must now declare the BackstageEntityCustomization they want to use
  via the `kratix.io/backstage-customization` label.
* Resources created with the label `kratix.io/backstage` set to `"false"` won't
  be processed by the Backstage Controller. This allows users to exclude
  specific resources from having entities in Backstage, such as the resources
  created by Compound Promises.


### [v0.1.2](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/#backstage-controller/v0.1.2/) (2025-06-05)

#### Fix

* `syntasso-registry` secret, containing a token that can access the syntasso image registry, is required in namespaces that the backstage controller workflows run.
This is so users' environments can pull the ske-backstage-generator image automatically instead of manually loading the image to their environment.

### [v0.1.1](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/#backstage-controller/v0.1.1/) (2025-05-28)

#### Features

* Initial release
