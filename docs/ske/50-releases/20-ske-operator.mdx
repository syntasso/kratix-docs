:::warning
This version of the Helm chart introduces a **breaking change** in how it manages
the Kratix CRD. To ensure a smooth upgrade, you must run the following manual
commands before upgrading:

```bash
kubectl --context=$PLATFORM label crd kratixes.platform.syntasso.io app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=Helm
kubectl --context=$PLATFORM annotate crd kratixes.platform.syntasso.io meta.helm.sh/release-name=ske-operator meta.helm.sh/release-namespace=kratix-platform-system
```

These steps are required to align the CRD management with the new Helm chart
structure. Failing to perform this migration will result in upgrade failures.
:::
