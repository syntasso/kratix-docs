## Release Notes

### [v0.15.0](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/#ske-operator/v0.15.0/) (2025-08-06)

Released in Helm Chart version [version 0.45.0](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/#ske-operator-helm-chart/0.45.0/)

#### Features

* You can configure custom CA issuer used for SKE certificates using ske-operator.

### [v0.14.0](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/#ske-operator/v0.14.0/) (2025-07-16)

Released in Helm Chart version [version 0.43.0](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/#ske-operator-helm-chart/0.43.0/)

#### Features

* The SKE Operator will now iterate over the available versions when upgrading
  SKE. For example, if your installation is on version `v0.29.0`, and you set
  the version to `v0.31.0`, the SKE Operator will first upgrade to `v0.30.0` and
  then to `v0.31.0`. This ensures a smooth upgrade process.
* Resource requests and limits of CPU and memory can now be configured for the SKE deployment.

### [v0.13.0](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/#ske-operator/v0.13.0/) (2025-07-11)

Released in Helm Chart version [version 0.42.0](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/#ske-operator-helm-chart/0.42.0/)

#### Features

* In rare occasions where a release version is not available, the SKE Operator
can now handle upgrades to the next appropriate version. The version is
determined by the `release-metadata.json` file within the release artefact.

### Helm Chart [v0.42.0](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/#ske-operator-helm-chart/0.42.0/)(2025-07-11)

##### Features

* Deleting the SKE Operator by uninstalling the Helm Chart will no longer result in the deletion of your SKE instances, CRDs or the registry secret. To

:::warning
This version of the Helm chart introduces a **breaking change** in how it manages
the Kratix CRD. To ensure a smooth upgrade, you must run the following manual
commands before upgrading:

```bash
kubectl --context=$PLATFORM label crd kratixes.platform.syntasso.io app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=Helm
kubectl --context=$PLATFORM annotate crd kratixes.platform.syntasso.io meta.helm.sh/release-name=ske-operator meta.helm.sh/release-namespace=kratix-platform-system
```

These steps are required to align the CRD management with the new Helm chart
structure. Failing to perform this migration will result in upgrade failures.
:::

* Support installing SKE Operator and SKE without cert-manager
