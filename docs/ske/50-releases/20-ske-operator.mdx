### [SKE Operator Helm Chart 0.26.0](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/#ske-operator-helm-chart/0.26.0/) (2024-11-26)

Deploys SKE Operator version [0.6.0](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/#ske-operator/v0.6.0/)

#### Features

* This chart provides support for provisioning additional SKE and Kubernetes resources alongside the SKE Operator and SKE Deployment. With the
`skeDeployment.additionalResources`, property, users can specify any additional resources that rely on the existence of a SKE Deployment
(e.g. Destinations, BucketStateStore) whilst the higher level `additionalResources` property can be used to specify any other Kubernetes resources
required (e.g. Secrets).

Released in Helm Chart [version 0.22.0](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/#ske-operator-helm-chart/0.22.0/)

:::warning
This version of the Helm chart introduces a **breaking change** in how it manages
the Kratix CRD. To ensure a smooth upgrade, you must run the following manual
commands before upgrading:

```bash
kubectl --context=$PLATFORM label crd kratixes.platform.syntasso.io app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=Helm
kubectl --context=$PLATFORM annotate crd kratixes.platform.syntasso.io meta.helm.sh/release-name=ske-operator meta.helm.sh/release-namespace=kratix-platform-system
```

These steps are required to align the CRD management with the new Helm chart
structure. Failing to perform this migration will result in upgrade failures.
:::
