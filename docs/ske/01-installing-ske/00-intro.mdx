## Upgrade Your Platform with Confidence

Upgrades are not maintenance. They are how your platform evolves.

In this video, we explain why keeping your SKE platform continuously updated is essential to security, stability, and long term operability. Left unmanaged, platforms decay. With the right model, they continuously improve.

We walk through the Kratix architecture and show how installation and upgrades use the exact same mechanism: a declarative change to the desired version. There are no bespoke upgrade scripts and no one off processes.

You declare the version you want. The SKE Operator reconciles towards it incrementally, performing health checks at each stage. Progress only continues when the platform is stable. The result is predictable, observable, and safe upgrades by design.

## Installing, Upgrading, and Removing SKE

This section details the methods you can use to install, upgrade and delete your SKE
installation.

This section is divided into two:

- In [Preconfigured installation](./preconfigured-install), you will find a preconfigured Job with all the required tools to install SKE in a given cluster. This is recommended for development and testing setups, and is the quickest way to get started.
- In [Advanced installation](./advanced-install), you will find a more detailed guide to installing SKE in more complex environments, like production, where customisations to the installation are required. This is recommended for production setups, and is the most flexible way to install SKE.
- In [Air-gapped installation](./air-gapped), you will find a guide on what you need to configure in order to deploy SKE in air-gapped environments.
- In [Upgrades](./upgrades), you will find a guide to upgrading your SKE instance.
- In [SKE Health Agent](./ske-health-agent), you will find a guide on how to install the SKE Health Agent in your Destinations.
- In [SKE GUI](./ske-gui), you will find a guide on how to deploy the SKE GUI which allows you to view your Kratix Promises and Resources.
