title: SKE Health Agent
description: Documentation about the SKE Health Agent
---

The SKE Health Agent is a health check agent to be installed in Kubernetes Destinations
where health checks can be executed.

The Agent is released separately from SKE. Its releases can be found [here](../releases/ske-health-agent).

## Features

The Agent will:

* Schedule the execution of Health Check Workflows from the Destination
* Persist the data from a health check into a state store

## Requirements

The Agent will write the health information to a state store.
The Platform cluster must have a GitOps agent listening to the state store,
so the resource health can be applied back to the Platform cluster.

## Install

The health agent is released separately from SKE. Its releases can be found
[in the SKE Health Agent release page](/ske/releases/ske-health-agent)
and it can be installed using the [helm chart](https://github.com/syntasso/helm-charts/tree/main/k8s-health-agent).

To install the agent using the Helm chart, start by adding the Syntasso Helm repository:

```bash
helm repo add syntasso https://syntasso.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

### Configure values

Helm can accept values via the values file. Any configuration should be placed in a values.yaml file
that is then passed in to the helm install command.

:::tip

You can see all available configuration in the
[helm chart repository](https://github.com/syntasso/helm-charts/blob/main/k8s-health-agent/values.yaml).

:::

### The SKE license

SKE Health Agent images are hosted in a private registry. To access these images, you will need to authenticate using
the token you have been provided with by Syntasso.

In your values file, you can set the `skeLicense` field to the license token provided to you by Syntasso.

```yaml
skeLicense: LICENSE # provided to you by Syntasso
```

:::warning

For the SKE Health Agent to work, you will need to make sure that your Destination cluster can access the Image Registry.

:::

### Image registry for Air-gapped Environments

You may want to manage the agent images within your own environment either due to air-gapped requirements
or other security measures.

To do this, you will need to set up image mirroring and configure the SKE Health Agent chart to pull image
from your own registry.

You must ensure that images listed below are mirrored to your own image registry and tagged according to the version:
- `registry.syntasso.io/syntasso/k8s-health-agent`
- `registry.syntasso.io/syntasso/health-check-adapter`

You can then customise `imageRegistry.host` in your values file:

```yaml
# Configuration for the image registry
# Update these values if you are using a private image registry
imageRegistry:
  host: "my-org.registry.io"
# ...
```

### Deploy the agent

Next, install the agent by running:

```bash
helm install health-agent syntasso/k8s-health-agent --values values.yaml
```

### Set up access to the State Store

You will need to create a ConfigMap and Secret with the credentials to access the state store.
The format will depend on the type os state store you wish to use.
The agent currently support two different types of state stores: S3-compatible buckets and Git repositories.

To configure a Git repository, create a ConfigMap and Secret with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: health-state-store-config
  namespace: k8s-health-agent-system
data:
  stateStoreKind: "GitStateStore"
  url: # address
  secretName: <secret name>
  branch: # optional (default: main)
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: <secret name>
  namespace: k8s-health-agent-system
stringData:
  # for basicAuth
  username: # username
  password: # password / API Token
```

:::info

`ssh` method for authentication is not currently supported.

:::

To configure a S3-compatible bucket, create a ConfigMap and Secret with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: health-state-store-config 
  namespace: k8s-health-agent-system
data:
  stateStoreKind: "BucketStateStore"
  endpoint: # address
  bucketName: # bucket name
  authMethod: # accessKey or IAM (default: accessKey)
  secretName: <secret name> # required for accessKey
  path: # path within the bucket; optional
  insecure: # true or false (default: false); optional
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: <secret name>
  namespace: k8s-health-agent-system
type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
stringData:
  accessKeyID: # accessKey ID
  secretAccessKey: # secret access key
```

:::warning

The configuration should be created _after_ installing agent, otherwise the namespace will not exist.
