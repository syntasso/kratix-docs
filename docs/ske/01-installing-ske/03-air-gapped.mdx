import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

You may want to manage SKE manifests and images within your own environment either
due to air-gapped requirements or other security and redundancy measures.

Regardless of the reason, if you want to host your own manifests and/or images you
will need to ensure that your Platform cluster has access to the following resources:

- An image registry containing the SKE Operator and additional SKE integration images
- A location where the SKE Release manifests can be found

Depending on your environment configuration, you will be instructed how to create
configuration and secrets the SKE Operator requires to access both the Image
Registry and manifest locations.

Manifests include reference to the SKE docker images. Do not directly change the manifest
to reference your image storage. If you need to change the image locations, you can do so
by using the image registry configuration fields on the SKE Operator which is documented
below.


:::note

The user associated with your SKE licence is `syntasso-pkg`. To pull the images
from the Syntasso Registry, first login with:

```bash
docker login --username syntasso-pkg registry.syntasso.io
```

You will be prompted for a password. The password is your Licence Key.

Once you have logged in, you can pull the images using the `docker pull`
command.

:::info Token overview
Review the [SKE tokens](/ske/reference/tokens) page for a reminder of which token to use for registry access and the recommended environment variable name (`SYNTASSO_TOKEN`).

## Image Registry

The SKE Operator and SKE images are stored in the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).

You must ensure that the following images are mirrored to your own image registry and
tagged according to the version.

- `registry.syntasso.io/syntasso/ske-operator`
- `registry.syntasso.io/syntasso/ske-platform`

You can find the available versions of the images in the [Syntasso Enterprise
Releases page](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/).

How to: Push the images to your internal registry

</summary>

Log in to the Syntasso registry

```bash
docker login registry.syntasso.io -u syntasso-pkg -p {SYNTASSO_TOKEN}
```

Pull the images at the desired tag

```bash
docker pull registry.syntasso.io/syntasso/ske-platform:latest
```

Tag the image to be pushed to your internal registry

```bash
docker tag registry.syntasso.io/syntasso/ske-platform:latest ${INTERNAL_REGISTRY}/syntasso/ske-platform:latest
```

Push the image to the internal registry

```bash
docker push ${INTERNAL_REGISTRY}/syntasso/ske-platform:latest
```

### Providing SKE Operator access to use your image registry

You need provide the SKE Operator with both the credentials and location to read your
image registry.

To create the Image Registry secret, run:

```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry <PULL SECRET NAME> \
    --namespace "kratix-platform-system" \
    --docker-username="<YOURUSERNAME>" \
    --docker-password="<YOURPASSWORD>" \
    --docker-server="<YOUR.REGISTRY.ADDRESS>"
```

You will need to reference this secret when installing SKE operator which is described in
each installation guide.


## SKE Release Storage

The manifests for SKE deployments are available in the [Syntasso Enterprise
Releases page](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/).

You need to host the manifests in your own S3-compatible bucket or Git repository that's
accessible from the Platform cluster.

The contents must match exactly the structure of the Syntasso Enterprise releases bucket.

In Git, all files/directories starting with `.` are ignored.

###  Providing SKE Operator access to use your release registry

To create the secret to access the SKE Release Storage:

<Tabs className="boxedTabs" groupId="stateStore">
  <TabItem value="bucket" label="Mirroring from Bucket">

  ```bash
  kubectl create secret generic <BUCKET SECRET NAME> \
      --namespace kratix-platform-system \
      --from-literal=accessKeyID="<YOURACCESSKEY>" \
      --from-literal=secretAccessKey="<YOURSECRETKEY>"
  ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="git" label="Mirroring from Git Repo">

  ```bash
  kubectl create secret generic <GIT SECRET NAME> \
      --namespace kratix-platform-system \
      --from-literal=username="<USERNAME>" \
      --from-literal=password="<PASSWORD>"
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


You will need to reference this secret when installing SKE operator which is described in
each installation guide.

## Install SKE via the Helm chart

With the mirrors in place, you can install SKE via the Helm chart. Refer to the [installation guide](/ske/installing-ske/advanced-install#via-helm-chart) for more details, and make sure to configure the [air-gapped mirrors](/ske/installing-ske/advanced-install#air-gapped-mirrors).
