The SKE GUI is a easy-to-use UI for viewing and managing Kratix Promises and Resources.
It introduces a clear, unified view of your entire platform, giving platform engineers visibility into resources and their states at a glance.

This page provides information on how to:

1. [Install SKE GUI](#install)
1. [Displaying Promises](#promises)
1. [Displaying Resources](#resources)
1. [Visualizing Kratix Objects](#map)


## Install SKE GUI {#install}

To install SKE GUI using the Helm chart, start by adding the Syntasso Helm
repository:

```bash
helm repo add syntasso https://syntasso.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

#### The SKE license

To run the GUI, you need a license token. If you've already installed SKE using the ske-operator chart,
you will have a SKE token that you can use for the SKE GUI. There's nothing you need to customize in the values file.

You need to customize the values file if:
1. the Kubernetes Secret containing your SKE token is not called `syntasso-registry`
2. you don't have SKE installed in your environment

In your values file, you can set the `skeLicense` field to the license token provided to you by Syntasso.
You can use an existing Secret for the licence token.

```yaml
skeLicense: LICENSE # provided to you by Syntasso
imageRegistry:
  imagePullSecret: null # when set to null, a secret "syntasso-registry" will be created as part of this chart
  # imagePullSecret: "my-own-secret" # use an existing secret; no need to set skeLicense in this case
  # you might want to create your own secret if you are using an internal image registry that requires authentication
```

### Configure values

Helm can accept values via the values file. Any configuration should be placed in a
`values.yaml` file that is then passed in to the `helm install` command.

:::tip

You can see all available configuration in the
[helm chart repository](https://github.com/syntasso/helm-charts/blob/main/ske-gui/values.yaml).

:::

### Install the SKE GUI

Next, install the SKE GUI:

```bash
helm install ske-gui syntasso/ske-gui \
  --namespace kratix-platform-system \
  --create-namespace \ # Optional; only use if `kratix-platform-system` namespace does not exist
  --wait \
  --values values.yaml # Optional; only use if you are configuring custom values.
```

#### Install the SKE GUI in Air-gapped Environments

You may want to manage the SKE GUI image within your own environment either
due to air-gapped requirements or other security measures.

To do this, you will need to set up image mirroring and configure the SKE GUI helm chart to pull images
from your own registry.

You must ensure that the following images are mirrored to your own image registry and tagged according to the version.

- `registry.syntasso.io/syntasso/ske-gui`

#### Verify your installation

You can check out the created deployment by running:

```bash
‚ùØ kubectl -n kratix-platform-system get deployment ske-gui
NAME      READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
ske-gui   1/1     1            1           154m
```

## The Promise Views {#promises}

When you open the SKE GUI, click on the cluster that you want to view your Kratix Promises and Resources. You
will see the "Kratix" sidebar entry in the left sidebar. When you click on this entry, you will see a list of all
the Kratix Promises.

From here, you can easily jump into the details of any specific Promise and view further information.
Within the Promise details, you can access crucial information, including:
* The status conditions of the Promise.
* The last time the associated pipeline ran.
* The ability to jump directly into the pipeline run itself.
* Visibility into the pods that were executed as part of that pipeline.
* Access to Kratix internal objects such as Works and Workplacements.

If you want to create a new Promise, click on the plus icon near to the Promises heading. You can enter the Promise
manifest in the opened YAML editor. Then click on the "Apply" button to create the Promise.

## The Resource Views {#resources}

Complementing the Promises view, the Resources tab allows you to see all the Kratix resources deployed across your cluster.
With filtering capabilities, you can narrow down your view by, for example, Promise or Namespace

Just like with Promises, you can click on any resource to view its details.
This includes seeing when its pipeline last ran, jumping into the pipeline, inspecting executed pods, and investigating
logs for all containers involved in the execution.

## Kratix Objects Overview {#map}

The map view visualizes all your deployed Promises and can help you understand their relationships.

Within the map view, you can click on a Promise to see the resources it owns, like its Resource Requests.
Furthermore, the map view highlights associated jobs, such as the pipeline jobs that executed the Promise.
