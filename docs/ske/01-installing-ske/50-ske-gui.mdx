The SKE GUI is a easy-to-use UI for viewing and managing Kratix Promises and Resources.
It introduces a clear, unified view of your entire platform, giving platform engineers visibility into resources and their states at a glance.

This page provides information on how to install the SKE GUI. For documentation on how to use the GUI, please refer to [SKE GUI usage guide](/ske/guides/ske-gui).

## Installation Steps

The GUI is released separately from SKE. Its releases can be found [in the SKE GUI release page](/ske/releases/ske-gui) and it can be installed using the [helm chart](https://github.com/syntasso/helm-charts/tree/main/ske-gui).

To install SKE GUI using the Helm chart, start by adding the Syntasso Helm repository:

```bash
helm repo add syntasso https://syntasso.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

### Configure values

Helm can accept values via the values file. Any configuration should be placed in a values.yaml file that is then passed in to the helm install command.

:::tip

You can see all available configuration in the
[helm chart repository](https://github.com/syntasso/helm-charts/blob/main/ske-gui/values.yaml).

:::

#### The SKE license

SKE GUI image is hosted in a private registry. To access the SKE GUI image, you will need to authenticate using the token you have been provided with by Syntasso.

The SKE GUI chart will, by default, use a secret named `syntasso-registry` in the `kratix-platform-system` namespace. This secret is created and managed by the SKE operator helm chart. If you wish to create a different image pull secret, you can run the following command:

```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry YOUR-SECRET-NAME \
  --namespace=kratix-platform-system \
  --docker-server=registry.syntasso.io \
  --docker-username=syntasso-pkg \
  --docker-password=<YOUR TOKEN>
```

The above command creates a Kubernetes Secret in namespace `kratix-platform-system`.
To use this secret in SKE GUI chart, you can customise `imageRegistry.imagePullSecret` in your values file.

```yaml
# Configuration for the image registry
# Update these values if you are using a private image registry
imageRegistry:
  imagePullSecret: YOUR-SECRET-NAME
# ...
```

#### Image registry for Air-gapped Environments

You may want to manage the GUI image within your own environment either due to air-gapped requirements or other security measures.

To do this, you will need to set up image mirroring and configure the SKE GUI chart to pull image
from your own registry.

You must ensure that image `registry.syntasso.io/syntasso/ske-gui` is mirrored to your own image registry and tagged according to the version.

You can then customise `imageRegistry.host` in your values file:

```yaml
# Configuration for the image registry
# Update these values if you are using a private image registry
imageRegistry:
  host: "my-org.registry.io"
# ...
```

#### Token to access SKE GUI

The helm chart creates a service account in the `kratix-platform-system` namespace with permission to access the SKE GUI. If you do not wish to create such service account, or you would like to give the service account a custom name,
you can customise in the values file:

```yaml
# ...
serviceAccount:
  create: true # default to true; set to false to skip SA creation
  name: "my-gui-sa" # default to `ske-gui-admin`
# ...
```

#### Configure OIDC for SKE GUI

You can optionally enable OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication for the SKE GUI. This allows you to integrate your existing identity provider and use single sign-on (SSO) to access the GUI.

To configure OIDC, update the following values in your `values.yaml`:

```yaml
# ...
oidc:
  issuerUrl: "https://your-identity-provider/realms/example"
  clientId: "your-client-id"
  clientSecret: "your-client-secret" # stored in a Kubernetes Secret that is automatically created by the chart
  # SKE GUI requests the profile and email scopes by default. More scopes can be added by using the following value.
  # scopes: profile,email
# ...
```

This configuration enables the SKE GUI to authenticate users against your chosen OIDC identity provider (for example, Keycloak, Google Identity, or Okta).

:::warning
You must tell your OIDC provider the callback URL that SKE GUI will use after login. This is your SKE GUI URL, plus `/oidc-callback`, for example:

`https://YOUR_URL/oidc-callback`
:::

#### Ingress server for SKE GUI

With the SKE GUI deployed in-cluster, you can choose to expose it through an ingress server.
The helm chart will not set up ingress by default. You need to turn it on in the values file and provide necessary configurations
for the ingress server. For example:
```yaml
# ...
ingress:
  enabled: true # Set to true to enable ingress server
  hosts:
    - host: ske.myplatform.io
      paths:
        - path: /
          type: Prefix
  tls:
    - secretName: my-ske-tls-secret # an existing secret with TLS certificates
      hosts:
        - "ske.myplatform.io"
# ...
```

### Deploy the SKE GUI

Next, install the SKE GUI by running:

```bash
helm install purple-platform syntasso/ske-gui \
  --namespace kratix-platform-system \
  --values values.yaml # Optional; only use if you are configuring custom values.
```

#### Verify your installation

You can check out the created SKE GUI deployment by running:

```bash
❯ kubectl -n kratix-platform-system get deployment ske-gui
NAME      READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
ske-gui   1/1     1            1           154m
```

#### Access the GUI

To access the GUI, you could port forward using the ske-gui service. For that, run:

```bash
kubectl -n kratix-platform-system port-forward svc/ske-gui 8080:80
```

If you have created an ingress server with the helm chart, you can access the GUI through your configured hosts.

There will be a prompt for you to enter a token to access the GUI, if you have created a service account with the helm chart,
you can generate a valid token by running:
```bash
kubectl -n kratix-platform-system create token ske-gui-admin
```

If you have configured [OIDC authentication](#configure-oidc-for-ske-gui) in your `values.yaml`, you can instead sign in using your identity provider credentials. When OIDC is enabled, the SKE GUI will automatically redirect to your OIDC login page, and you won’t need to generate or provide a service account token manually.

:::note

The Kubernetes cluster where Kratix is installed must be configured with the same OIDC provider and have the required permissions to display Kratix resources.
