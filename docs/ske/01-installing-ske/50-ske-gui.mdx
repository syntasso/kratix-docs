The SKE GUI is a easy-to-use UI for viewing and managing Kratix Promises and Resources.
It introduces a clear, unified view of your entire platform, giving platform engineers visibility into resources and their states at a glance.

This page provides information on how to install the SKE GUI. For documentation on how to use the GUI, please refer to [SKE GUI usage guide](../../guides/ske-gui).

## Installation Steps

The GUI is released separately from SKE. Its releases can be found [in the SKE GUI release page](../../releases/ske-gui).

SKE GUI can be installed using the [helm chart](https://github.com/syntasso/helm-charts/tree/main/ske-gui).

To install SKE GUI using the Helm chart, start by adding the Syntasso Helm repository:

```bash
helm repo add syntasso https://syntasso.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

### Configure values

Helm can accept values via the values file. Any configuration should be placed in a values.yaml file that is then passed in to the helm install command.
For all available configurations, please refer to the default values file in [SKE GUI chart](https://github.com/syntasso/helm-charts/blob/main/ske-gui/values.yaml).

Below are instructions on how you could use the values file to configure SKE license and image registry.

#### The SKE license

SKE GUI image is hosted in a private registry.
To access the SKE GUI image, you will need to authenticate using the token you have been provided with by Syntasso.

The SKE GUI chart will, be default, use a secret named `syntasso-registry` in the `kratix-platform-system` namespace. This secret is created and managed by the SKE operator helm chart.
If you wish to create a different image pull secret, you can run the following command:

```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry YOUR-SECRET-NAME \
  --namespace=kratix-platform-system \
  --docker-server=registry.syntasso.io \
  --docker-username=syntasso-pkg \
  --docker-password=<YOUR TOKEN>
```

The above command creates a Kubernetes Secret in namespace `kratix-platform-system`.
To use this secret in SKE GUI chart, you can customize `imageRegistry.imagePullSecret` in your values file.

```yaml
# Configuration for the image registry
# Update these values if you are using a private image registry
imageRegistry:
  imagePullSecret: YOUR-SECRET-NAME
# ...
```

#### Image registry for Air-gapped Environments

You may want to manage the GUI image within your own environment either due to air-gapped requirements or other security measures.

To do this, you will need to set up image mirroring and configure the SKE GUI chart to pull image
from your own registry.

You must ensure that image `registry.syntasso.io/syntasso/ske-gui` is mirrored to your own image registry and tagged according to the version.

You can then customize `imageRegistry.host` in your values file:

```yaml
# Configuration for the image registry
# Update these values if you are using a private image registry
imageRegistry:
  host: "my-org.registry.io"
# ...
```

### Deploy the SKE GUI

Next, install the SKE GUI by running:

```bash
helm install ske-gui syntasso/ske-gui \
  --namespace kratix-platform-system \
  --wait \
  --values values.yaml # Optional; only use if you are configuring custom values.
```

#### Install the SKE GUI in Air-gapped Environments

You may want to manage the SKE GUI image within your own environment either
due to air-gapped requirements or other security measures.

To do this, you will need to set up image mirroring and configure the SKE GUI helm chart to pull images
from your own registry.

You must ensure that the following images are mirrored to your own image registry and tagged according to the version.

- `registry.syntasso.io/syntasso/ske-gui`

#### Verify your installation

You can check out the created SKE GUI deployment by running:

```bash
‚ùØ kubectl -n kratix-platform-system get deployment ske-gui
NAME      READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
ske-gui   1/1     1            1           154m
```

Your SKE GUI installation is complete and ready to use!
Refer to the [SKE GUI usage guide](../../guides/ske-gui) for instructions on how to navigate the UI.
