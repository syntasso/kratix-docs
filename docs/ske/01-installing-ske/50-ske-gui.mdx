The SKE GUI is a easy-to-use UI for viewing and managing Kratix Promises and Resources.
It introduces a clear, unified view of your entire platform, giving platform engineers visibility into resources and their states at a glance.

This page provides information on how to install the SKE GUI. For documentation on how to use the GUI, please refer to []().

## Installation Steps

The GUI is released separately from SKE. Its releases can be found [in the SKE GUI release page](../../releases/ske-gui).

SKE GUI can be installed using the [helm chart](https://github.com/syntasso/helm-charts/tree/main/ske-gui).

To install SKE GUI using the Helm chart, start by adding the Syntasso Helm repository:

```bash
helm repo add syntasso https://syntasso.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

### Configure values

Helm can accept values via the values file. Any configuration should be placed in a values.yaml file that is then passed in to the helm install command.
For all available configurations, please refer to the default values file in [SKE GUI chart](https://github.com/syntasso/helm-charts/blob/main/ske-gui/values.yaml).

Below are instructions on how you could use the values file to configure SKE license and image registry.

#### The SKE license

SKE GUI image is hosted in a private registry.
To access the SKE GUI image, you will need to authenticate using the token you have been provided with by Syntasso.

The SKE GUI chart will, be default, use a secret named `syntasso-registry` in the `kratix-platform-system` namespace. This secret is created and managed by the SKE operator helm chart.
If you wish to create a different image pull secret, you can run the following command:

```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry YOUR-SECRET-NAME \
  --namespace=kratix-platform-system \
  --docker-server=registry.syntasso.io \
  --docker-username=syntasso-pkg \
  --docker-password=<YOUR TOKEN>
```

The above command creates a Kubernetes Secret in namespace `kratix-platform-system`.
To use this secret in SKE GUI chart, you can customize `imageRegistry.imagePullSecret` in your values file.

```yaml
# Configuration for the image registry
# Update these values if you are using a private image registry
imageRegistry:
  imagePullSecret: YOUR-SECRET-NAME
# ...
```

#### Image registry for Air-gapped Environments

You may want to manage the GUI image within your own environment either due to air-gapped requirements or other security measures.

To do this, you will need to set up image mirroring and configure the SKE GUI chart to pull image
from your own registry.

You must ensure that image `registry.syntasso.io/syntasso/ske-gui` is mirrored to your own image registry and tagged according to the version.

You can then customize `imageRegistry.host` in your values file:

```yaml
# Configuration for the image registry
# Update these values if you are using a private image registry
imageRegistry:
  host: "my-org.registry.io"
# ...
```

### Deploy the SKE GUI

Next, install the SKE GUI by running:

```bash
helm install ske-gui syntasso/ske-gui \
  --namespace kratix-platform-system \
  --wait \
  --values values.yaml # Optional; only use if you are configuring custom values.
```

#### Install the SKE GUI in Air-gapped Environments

You may want to manage the SKE GUI image within your own environment either
due to air-gapped requirements or other security measures.

To do this, you will need to set up image mirroring and configure the SKE GUI helm chart to pull images
from your own registry.

You must ensure that the following images are mirrored to your own image registry and tagged according to the version.

- `registry.syntasso.io/syntasso/ske-gui`

#### Verify your installation

You can check out the created SKE GUI deployment by running:

```bash
‚ùØ kubectl -n kratix-platform-system get deployment ske-gui
NAME      READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
ske-gui   1/1     1            1           154m
```

## The Promise Views {#promises}

When you open the SKE GUI, click on the cluster that you want to view your Kratix Promises and Resources. You
will see the "Kratix" sidebar entry in the left sidebar. When you click on this entry, you will see a list of all
the Kratix Promises.

From here, you can easily jump into the details of any specific Promise and view further information.
Within the Promise details, you can access crucial information, including:
* The status conditions of the Promise.
* The last time the associated pipeline ran.
* The ability to jump directly into the pipeline run itself.
* Visibility into the pods that were executed as part of that pipeline.
* Access to Kratix internal objects such as Works and Workplacements.

If you want to create a new Promise, click on the plus icon near to the Promises heading. You can enter the Promise
manifest in the opened YAML editor. Then click on the "Apply" button to create the Promise.

## The Resource Views {#resources}

Complementing the Promises view, the Resources tab allows you to see all the Kratix resources deployed across your cluster.
With filtering capabilities, you can narrow down your view by, for example, Promise or Namespace

Just like with Promises, you can click on any resource to view its details.
This includes seeing when its pipeline last ran, jumping into the pipeline, inspecting executed pods, and investigating
logs for all containers involved in the execution.

## Kratix Objects Overview {#map}

The map view visualizes all your deployed Promises and can help you understand their relationships.

Within the map view, you can click on a Promise to see the resources it owns, like its Resource Requests.
Furthermore, the map view highlights associated jobs, such as the pipeline jobs that executed the Promise.
