The Promise Testing Framework paves the way for easy testing of Kratix Promises, providing fast feedback and confidence in your Pipelines and Stages
without needing to deploy your Promise.

Available as plugin to the [Kratix CLI](/main/kratix-cli/intro), the framework provides validation of the expected behaviour when Pipelines and Pipeline Stages run and validation of
the outputs generated when Pipelines and individual stages run to completion.

## Prerequisites

You must have the `kratix` CLI installed at version `0.9.0` or later.

## Installing the Testing Framework

Download the latest `kratix-test` plugin binary from the [SKE Releases Bucket](http://syntasso-enterprise-releases.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/#ske-testing-framework/). Place the binary anywhere on your `PATH`.

As a the binary is in your path, is should be visible when you run:

```bash
kratix plugin list
```

To confirm that the plugin has been installed without issue, run:

```bash
kratix test --help
```

You should see output similar to:

```bash
A command for testing Kratix Promise stages

Usage:
  test [command]

Available Commands:
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  help        Help about any command
  pipeline    A command for testing Kratix Promise Pipelines
  stage       A command for testing Kratix Promise stages

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for test

Use "test [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## Testing your Promise with the Testing Framework

Given your Promise was generated with the Kratix CLI, the directory structure should be similar to the following:

```bash
├── README.md
├── example-resource.yaml
├── promise.yaml
└── workflows
    └── promise
        └── configure
            └── setup
                ├── deploy-infrastructure
                │   ├── Dockerfile
                │   ├── resources
                │   └── scripts
                │       └── pipeline.sh
                ├── apply-rbac-rules
                │   ├── Dockerfile
                │   ├── resources
                │   └── scripts
                │       └── pipeline.sh
                └── security-scan
                    ├── Dockerfile
                    ├── resources
                    └── scripts
                        └── pipeline.sh
```

When structured in this format, both the `kratix test stage` and `kratix test pipeline` can identify the appropriate image to
run or build when performing tests against the specified Pipeline or Pipeline stage. If your directory is not structured in this way, the
tests main fail find the correct container image to run.

### Testing individual Pipeline Stages

To test given Pipeline Stage, you can use to `kratix test stage` command, specifying the workflow type, workflow action,
Pipeline name and stage name that you wish to test. Alongside these arguments, you will also need to provide:

- Test input via the `--input-dir` flag. This is a directory that should contain the `object.yaml` that you want test your Stage against
- Expected test outputs via the `--expected-output-dir`. This should contain files that match the files that you expect to be written
to the `/kratix/outputs` directory by the stage.

For the above example, we could run:

```bash
kratix test stage promise/configure/setup deploy-infrastructure \
  --input-dir inputs \
  --expected-output-dir setup-outputs
```

This will run the container for the Pipeline Stage (as specified in the `promise.yaml`) with the 
[default workflow environment variables](/main/reference/workflows#environment-variables) set for you. Upon running the stage container, the test
validates whether the outputs generated by the Stage match those in the `setup-outputs` directory. If they match, the command will display a success message and
exit 0.

```bash
Running
Validating
- Comparing /expected-stage-outputs/configmap.yaml to /test-outputs2423274464/configmap.yaml

Cleaning up
Success (1 assertion(s))
```

However, if they do not match, the test will display a diff between the files and exit 1.

```bash
--- expected
+++ actual
@@ -1,4 +1,5 @@
 apiVersion: v1
 kind: ConfigMap
 metadata:
-  name: infra-config
+  creationTimestamp: null
+  name: map

Cleaning up
Failure (1 assertion(s) failed)
```

:::info
You can also provide an tag for a build image via the `--image-tag` in place of the pipeline and stage name arguments. When taking this approach,
your promise does not need to match the above directory structure.
:::

### Testing a Pipeline

To test a Pipeline by running each of its Stages in sequence, you can use the `kratix test pipeline command`. For the above example, we could run:

```bash
kratix test pipeline promise/configure/setup \
  --input-dir inputs \
  --expected-output-dir setup-outputs
```

This will run each of the Stages of the `setup` pipeline and and validate whether the outputs generated by all of the Stages match those in the
`setup-outputs` directory. If they match, the command will exit 0. However, if they do not match, the test will display a diff between the files
and exit 1.

:::tip
You can use the `--build` flag to build with both the `stage` and `pipeline` commands to build the Pipeline Stages before running the tests
