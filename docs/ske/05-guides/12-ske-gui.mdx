The SKE GUI is a easy-to-use UI for viewing and managing Kratix Promises and Resources.
It introduces a clear, unified view of your entire platform, giving platform engineers visibility into resources and their states at a glance.

This page provides information on how to use the SKE GUI. For documentation on how to install the GUI, please refer to [SKE GUI installation guide](../installing-ske/ske-gui).

## The Promise Views {#promises}

When you open the SKE GUI, click on the cluster that you want to view your Kratix Promises and Resources. You
will see the "Kratix" sidebar entry in the left sidebar. When you click on this entry, you will see a list of all
the Kratix Promises.

From here, you can easily jump into the details of any specific Promise and view further information.
Within the Promise details, you can access crucial information, including:
* The status conditions of the Promise.
* The last time the associated pipeline ran.
* The ability to jump directly into the pipeline run itself.
* Visibility into the pods that were executed as part of that pipeline.
* Access to Kratix internal objects such as Works and Workplacements.

If you want to create a new Promise, click on the plus icon near to the Promises heading. You can enter the Promise
manifest in the opened YAML editor. Then click on the "Apply" button to create the Promise.

## The Resource Views {#resources}

Complementing the Promises view, the Resources tab allows you to see all the Kratix resources deployed across your cluster.
With filtering capabilities, you can narrow down your view by, for example, Promise or Namespace

Just like with Promises, you can click on any resource to view its details.
This includes seeing when its pipeline last ran, jumping into the pipeline, inspecting executed pods, and investigating
logs for all containers involved in the execution.

## Kratix Objects Overview {#map}

The map view visualizes all your deployed Promises and can help you understand their relationships.

Within the map view, you can click on a Promise to see the resources it owns, like its Resource Requests.
Furthermore, the map view highlights associated jobs, such as the pipeline jobs that executed the Promise.
