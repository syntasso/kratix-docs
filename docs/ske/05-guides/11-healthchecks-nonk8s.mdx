## Pre-requisites

You will need:
1. an installation of SKE. Go to [Configuring SKE](/ske/installing-ske/intro) and follow the appropriate guide if you haven't done so already.
2. a configured and deployed Health Agent. You can do this by following the guide on [Configuring the Kubernetes Health Agent](/ske/installing-ske/ske-health-agent).

It's also recommended that you first read through the guide on [how to implement resource Health Checks](healthchecks) for a more detailed and step-by-step guide on how health checks work in SKE.

In this guide we will explore a Promise that runs Health Checks on non Kubernetes resources.

## How to run Health Checks on resources outside of your Destination

Health Checks are implemented in SKE via `HealthDefinition` objects. As part of a Health Definition, you can provide a set of Pipeline Stages that encapsulate your health check logic, including making API calls to external resources that live outside of your Kubernetes Destination.

## Example Promise

Here we have an outline of an AWS DB Promise. This Promise provides an AWS RDS as a service.

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: Promise
metadata:
  name: aws-rds
spec:
  api:
    apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
    kind: CustomResourceDefinition
    metadata:
      name: rds.aws.marketplace.kratix.io
    spec:
      group: aws.marketplace.kratix.io
      names:
        kind: RDS
        plural: rds
        singular: rds
      scope: Namespaced
      versions:
        - name: v1alpha1
          schema:
            openAPIV3Schema:
              properties:
                spec:
...
          served: true
          storage: true
  #highlight-start
  workflows:
    resource:
      configure:
        - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
          kind: Pipeline
          metadata:
            name: rds-configure
          spec:
            containers:
              - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/aws-rds-pipelines:v0.1.0
                name: configure-rds-instance
                env:
                  - name: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
                    valueFrom:
                      secretKeyRef:
                        name: aws-rds
                        key: accessKeyID
                  - name: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
                    valueFrom:
                      secretKeyRef:
                        name: aws-rds
                        key: secretAccessKey
              - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/rds-generate-health-check:v0.1.0
                name: generate-health-check
                 #highlight-end
      delete:
...
```

There are one two containers within the Resource Configure pipeline 'rds-configure'. The first container `aws-rds-pipelines` will provision and manage the RDS instance.
While the second container `rds-generate-health-check` can schedule a Health Definition that checks for RDS status.

For reference, the generated Health Definition could look like:

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: HealthDefinition
metadata:
  name: aws-rds-RESOURCE_NAME-RESOURCE_NS
  namespace: default # this can be any namespace that exists in the Destination
spec:
  resourceRef:
    name: RESOURCE_NAME
    namespace: RESOURCE_NS
  promiseRef:
    name: aws-rds
  schedule: @hourly
  input: |
    name: RESOURCE_NAME
  workflow:
    apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Pipeline
    metadata:
      name: healthcheck
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/rds-health-check:v0.1.0
        name: check-rds-status
        ...
EOF
```

This Healthcheck Definition will then be scheduled to a Destination and a Kubernetes CronJob will be created to execute container `rds-health-check` on a hourly schedule.

Logic in the health check container is completely up to you, as long as the container writes the health check result to `/kratix/output/health-status.yaml` with the format:
```
state: # can be of unknown, ready, unhealthy, healthy, or degraded
details: # optional additional information to set in the resource request health status
  ...
```

To check the status of a RDS instance, you might have the container `rds-health-check` running a script that queries the instance status.

For example:
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -euo pipefail

# read data from the input object
name="$(yq eval '.metadata.name' /kratix/input/object.yaml)"
namespace="$(yq eval '.metadata.namespace' /kratix/input/object.yaml)"
engine="$(yq eval '.spec.engine' /kratix/input/object.yaml)"

region="eu-west-1"
db_identifier="${name}-${namespace}-${engine}"

aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier ${db_identifier} --region ${region} > instance-output.json

instance_status=$(jq -r '.DBInstances[0].DBInstanceStatus' instance-output.json)

cat <<EOF > /kratix/metadata/status.yaml
instanceStatus: ${instance_status}
instanceIdentifier: ${db_identifier}
EOF

if [[ "$instanceStatus" == "available" ]]; then
    state="healthy"
elif [[ "$instanceStatus" == "upgrading" || "$instanceStatus" == "starting" ]]; then
    state="degraded"
else
    state="unknown"
fi

cat <<EOF > /kratix/output/health-status.yaml
state: ${state}
details:
  instanceStatus: ${instance_status}
EOF

```

The above scripts will write the health check result to `/kratix/output/health-status.yaml`.
The SKE health agent will then produce a Health Record and write to the registered state store.
SKE will reconcile the Health Record and update the Resource Request health status.
