#### Pre-requisites

You need a fresh installation of Kratix for this section. The simplest way to do so is by running the quick-start script from within the Kratix directory.

```bash
./scripts/quick-start.sh --recreate
```

Alternatively, you can go back to [Installing Kratix](./installing-kratix) and follow the appropriate guide.
