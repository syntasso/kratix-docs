### Installing and Configuring a GitOps agent

Now that your Kubernetes Destination is created and Kratix is aware of it, the
last step is to install and configure a GitOps agent so that Kubernetes documents
that get written to the `StateStore` are deployed to the cluster. Kratix is agnostic to
which GitOps agent you choose to use. See our [GitOps Agent installation](../../category/installing-gitops-agent)
documentation for configuring the GitOps agent of your choice.
