Flux will eventually reconcile the cluster's state, making the `worker` cluster ready
to receive workloads. You can verify its readiness by observing the `kratix-worker-system`
namespace appearing in the `worker` cluster:

```shell-session
$ kubectl --context $WORKER get namespaces
NAME                   STATUS   AGE
...
kratix-worker-system   Active   1m
...
```

ðŸŽ‰   **Congratulations!** Kratix is now installed! Jump to [Installing and using a Promise](installing-a-promise) to spin up your first as-a-service offering.
