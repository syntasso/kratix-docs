## Set up Kratix

:::warning

These instructions are intended for teams preparing to install Kratix in semi-permanent
or permanent environments.

If you are just getting started and have access to a disposable/empty cluster we highly
recommend you get started with the [quick start](../../main/quick-start) instructions
which can be used on all Kubernetes clusters and configures a Kratix and its first
Destination and State Store backed by MinIO which is configured for learning but is not
robust or durable enough for production use.

### Install cert-manager

<PartialInstallCertManager />

### Install Kratix

Install Kratix on the Platform Cluster.

```bash
kubectl apply --context $PLATFORM --filename https://github.com/syntasso/kratix/releases/latest/download/kratix.yaml
```

You can also install and configure Kratix with Helm. For more information, see
the [Helm Chart](https://github.com/syntasso/helm-charts) documentation.

Make sure that `kratix` is ready before proceeding:

```shell-session
$ kubectl --context $PLATFORM get pods --namespace kratix-platform-system
NAME                                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kratix-platform-controller-manager-78d57569b-bn4t4   2/2     Running   0          25s
```
