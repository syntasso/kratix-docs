#### Pre-requisites

If you completed the environment cleanup steps at the end of the previous
workshop chapter you're good to go! If you did not cleanup or ran into issues you
can run the following from inside the Kratix repo to get a fresh environment:

```bash
./scripts/quick-start.sh --recreate
```

Also, make sure to that the following environment variables are set:

```bash
export PLATFORM="kind-platform"
export WORKER="kind-worker"
```
