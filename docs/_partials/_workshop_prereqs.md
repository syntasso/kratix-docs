#### Pre-requisites

If you completed the environment cleanup steps at the end of the previous 
workshop chapter your good to go! If you did not cleanup or ran into issues you 
can run the following from inside the Kratix repo to get a fresh environment:

```bash
./scripts/quick-start.sh --recreate
```
