# The power of Promises {#power-of-promises}

As covered previously, Promises are the building blocks that enable teams to design platforms that specifically meet their customer needs. Through writing and extending Promises, Platform teams can raise the value line of the platform they provide. They can use multiple simpler, low-level Promises to provide an experience tailored to their users needs.

Consider the task of setting up development environments for application teams. This task is usually repetitive and requires many cookie-cutter steps. It may involve wiring up Git repos, spinning up a CI/CD server, creating a PaaS to run the applications, instructing CI/CD to listen to the Git repos and push successful builds into the PaaS, and finally wiring applications to their required data services.

A Promise can encapsulate all the required steps and handle the toil of running those low-level tasks. It can be designed as a single Promise that does it all, or it can be a collection of Promises that, combined, deliver the desired functionality.

Now you will see the power of Kratix Promises by deploying a web app that uses multiple Promises.

1. [Summary](#summary)
1. [Cleanup environment](#cleanup)

### Install all required Promises {#install-all-promises}

In order for an application team to deploy an application to a dev environment they require a relational datastore (postgres), networking for user traffic (Knative), and a CI/CD service for ongoing improvements (Jenkins). To deliver this functionality on-demand with Kratix install the required Promises on your platform cluster:

```console
kubectl --context kind-platform apply --filename https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syntasso/kratix/main/samples/postgres/postgres-promise.yaml
kubectl --context kind-platform apply --filename https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syntasso/kratix/main/samples/knative-serving/knative-serving-promise.yaml
kubectl --context kind-platform apply --filename https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syntasso/kratix/main/samples/jenkins/jenkins-promise.yaml
```
<br />

Verify the Promises are all installed on your platform cluster
```console
kubectl --context kind-platform get promises
```

The above command will give an output similar to
```console
NAME                      AGE
ha-postgres-promise       1m
jenkins-promise           1m
knative-serving-promise   1m
```
<br />

Verify the CRDs are all installed on your platform cluster. Note that you know have `jenkins`, `knativeserving`, and `postgres` available.

```console
kubectl --context kind-platform get crds
```

The above command will give an output similar to
```console
NAME                                          CREATED AT
clusters.platform.kratix.io                   2022-09-23T14:37:20Z

```
<br />

<p>Verify the <code>workerClusterResources</code> (more details in future steps) are installed on your worker cluster<br />
<sub>(This may take a few minutes so <code>--watch</code> will watch the command. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to stop watching)</sub>
</p>

```console
kubectl --context kind-worker get pods --watch
```

The above command will give an output similar to
```console
NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
jenkins-operator-6c89d97d4f-r474w    1/1     Running   0          1m
postgres-operator-7dccdbff7c-2hqhc   1/1     Running   0          1m
```
<br />

### Request instances {#request-instances}

![Overview-instances](/img/docs/Treasure_Trove-Get_instances_of_multiple_Promises.jpeg)

Submit a set of Kratix Resource Requests to get a Knative Serving component, a Jenkins instance and a Postgres database.
```console
kubectl --context kind-platform apply --filename https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syntasso/kratix/main/samples/postgres/postgres-resource-request.yaml
kubectl --context kind-platform apply --filename https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syntasso/kratix/main/samples/knative-serving/knative-serving-resource-request.yaml
kubectl --context kind-platform apply --filename https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syntasso/kratix/main/samples/jenkins/jenkins-resource-request.yaml
```
<br />

<p>By requesting these three resources, you will start three pods, one for the Jenkins server (named <code>jenkins-example</code>), and two which create a postgres cluster (named per the Resource Request name, <code>acid-minimal</code>). To verify you have all the necessary resources up and running<br />
<sub>(This may take a few minutes so <code>--watch</code> will watch the command. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to stop watching)</sub>
</p>

```console
kubectl --context kind-worker get pods --watch
```

The above command will give an output similar to
```console
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS         AGE
acid-minimal-cluster-0                    1/1     Running   0                5m
acid-minimal-cluster-1                    1/1     Running   0                5m
jenkins-example                           1/1     Running   0                5m
...
```
<br />

Verify that knative has also installed its networking resources into two new namespaces
```console
kubectl --context kind-worker get namespaces
```
<br />

The above command will give an output similar to
```console
NAME                   STATUS   AGE
knative-serving        Active   1h
kourier-system         Active   1h
...
```
<br />

Verify that the Kratix Resource Request was issued on the platform cluster.
```console
kubectl --context kind-platform get jenkins.example.promise.syntasso.io
```
<br />

The above command will give an output similar to
```console
NAME          AGE
example       1m
```
<br />

<p>Verify the instance is created on the worker cluster<br />
<sub>(This may take a few minutes so <code>--watch</code> will watch the command. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to stop watching)</sub>
</p>

```console
kubectl --context kind-worker get pods --namespace default --watch
```

The above command will give an output similar to
```console
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
jenkins-example                     1/1     Running   0          1m
jenkins-operator-7886c47f9c-zschr   1/1     Running   0          10m
```
<br />

#### Run the application deploy pipeline {#deploy-pipeline}

With all the necessary resources available, you will now change hats to be a part of the application team who can now design and run their own CI/CD pipeline using the provided Jenkins service. In this step, you will deploy a [sample application](https://github.com/syntasso/sample-golang-app) through a Jenkins pipeline, that uses Postgres for persistence and Knative for serving the application.

Access the Jenkins UI in a browser, as in the [previous step](installing-a-promise).

<br />

Port forward for browser access to the Jenkins UI
```console
kubectl --context kind-worker port-forward jenkins-example 8080:8080
```
<br />

Navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and log in with the credentials you get from the commands below:

```console jsx title="username"
kubectl --context kind-worker get secret jenkins-operator-credentials-example \
    -o 'jsonpath={.data.user}' | base64 -d
```
```console jsx title="password"
kubectl --context kind-worker get secret jenkins-operator-credentials-example \
    -o 'jsonpath={.data.password}' | base64 -d
```
<br />

In the Jenkins UI, create a new pipeline using this
[Jenkinsfile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syntasso/sample-golang-app/main/ci/Jenkinsfile)
and execute it.

For those that are less familiar with Jenkins, you can either expand the instructions below or watch the video to see how to navigate the UI for this task.

</video>
</div>


### Validate the deployment {#validate-deployment}

Verify that the Knative Service for the application is ready:

```console
kubectl --context kind-worker get services.serving.knative.dev
```

The above command will give an output similar to
```console
NAME   URL                            LATESTCREATED   LATESTREADY   READY   REASON
todo   http://todo.default.local.gd   todo-00001      todo-00001    True
```
<br />

### Test the deployed application {#test-app}

Now test the app.

On a separate terminal, you'll need to open access to the app by port-forwarding the kourier service:

```console
kubectl --context kind-worker --namespace kourier-system port-forward svc/kourier 8081:80
```
<br />

Now go to [http://todo.default.local.gd:8081](http://todo.default.local.gd:8081) to see the app running.

## Summary {#summary}
Your platform has pieced together three different Promises to provide a complete solution for an application team to deploy a new service to dev using your suggested CI/CD and hosting solutions. Well done!

To recap the steps we took:
1. ✅&nbsp;&nbsp;Installed all three Kratix Promises
1. ✅&nbsp;&nbsp;Requested an instance of each Kratix Promise
1. ✅&nbsp;&nbsp;Created and run a CI/CD pipeline for a new application
1. ✅&nbsp;&nbsp;Viewed an endpoint from a newly deployed and networked application

This is only the beginning of working with Promises. Next you will learn how to write and update Promises, and in the final thoughts we will showcase the composability of Promises to further optimise this workflow from three requests down to one.
