title: What does Kratix creates on new Promises or Requests?
id: kratix-resources

Whenever a new Promise is installed, or a new Resource is requested, Kratix will create a
series of supporting Kubernetes Objects to complete the installation or to fulfill the
Promise.

In this page, we will explore what are those objects.

There are two categories of Objects that Kratix creates:

1. The Objects it needs to execute the Workflows.
1. The Objects that represent the Workflows output.

The diagram below shows all of the Objects Kratix creates. We will dive deeper into what
they are used for later.

## Workflow Resources

To execute the Workflows, Kratix will create the following objects:

### The ConfigMap

As you can see in the diagram above, Kratix adds a series of containers to the Pod that
will be used to run the Workflow. This ConfigMap contains the information those
containers need to schedule works according to the destination selectors found in the
Promise.

You can find all Kratix-created ConfigMap by filtering by them by the `kratix.io/promise-name` label.
