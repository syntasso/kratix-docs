### Using Kratix to build your platform you can:

* use GitOps workflow and familiar Kubernetes-native constructs.
* co-create capabilities by providing a clear contract between application and platform teams through the definition and creation of _Promises_. Learn more about Kratix Promises [here](../main/reference/promises/intro).
* create a flexible platform with your paved paths as Promises.
* evolve your platform easily as your business needs change.
* start small on a laptop and expand to multi-team, multi-cluster, multi-region, and multi-cloud with a consistent API everywhere.

To see how you can use Kratix to deliver compelling Platforms, including

### Providing a Kratix-built platform allows your users to:

* discover available services that are already fit-for-purpose.
* consume services on demand using standard APIs.
* move focus away from infrastructure toward adding product value.
