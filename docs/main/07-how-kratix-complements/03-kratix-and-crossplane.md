_**[Crossplane](https://www.crossplane.io/)** is an open-source multi-cloud control plane that allows you to extend Kubernetes to connect to and from external sources like databases, the cloud and the edge._

_We have written a tremendous [blog](https://www.syntasso.io/post/building-your-platform-your-way-with-crossplane-and-kratix) about how Kratix and Crossplane complement each other._

[Kratix Promises](../reference/promises/intro) and [Crossplane Compositions](https://docs.crossplane.io/v1.13/concepts/compositions/) are similar in that they both provide declarative APIs and a facade into more complicated underlying platform orchestration.

Kratix does not aim to compete with Crossplane on cloud orchestration and it can help a platform builder already using Crossplane.

- Creating a [Promise](../reference/promises/intro) for
  Crossplane simplifies the Crossplane installation experience.
- Kratix provides [multi-cluster
  support](../reference/deployment-topology) for
  free. Where Crossplane users are managing several Crossplane provider
  clusters, Kratix complements by providing the cross-cluster management of
  resources.
- A Promise can abstract away Crossplane. If a Platform needs to provide a
  Postgres as a Service with a production version managed by Crossplane _and_
  and they also need to provide an inexpensive dev version that is run on a
  densified development cluster then this can be handled for free with Kratix
  via Promises. See the
  [blog](https://www.syntasso.io/post/building-your-platform-your-way-with-crossplane-and-kratix)
  for more detail on this pattern.
- [Kratix Promises](../reference/promises/intro) can offer the
  benefits of Workflows. Tasks such as billing checks, security scans, audits,
  resource decoration etc can all happen in the Promise before a delegation to
  Crossplane is made.
- Kratix provides GitOps out of the box so the state of Crossplane resources is
  all managed for free.
