description: How Kratix workflows access secrets via the Kubernetes model.
---

Kratix workflows run in Kubernetes and use the native `Secret` model. If a
workflow needs credentials or tokens, create a Kubernetes `Secret` and reference
it as you would for any other Pod. There is no Kratix-specific secret store;
workflow Pods inherit whatever access you grant in the cluster.

See the Kubernetes docs for the core concepts and usage:
- [Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/)
- [Using Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#using-a-secret)

## Integrating external secret stores

There are many ways to source secrets from external systems and sync them into Kubernetes.
Common approaches include:
- [Sealed Secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets) for storing encrypted secrets in Git.
- [External Secrets Operator](https://external-secrets.io/latest/) to pull from cloud secret managers.
- [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) via a Kubernetes auth method and sync controller.

Once those tools materialize a Kubernetes `Secret`, Kratix workflows can use it
as-is. This keeps Kratix aligned with the Kubernetes security model and lets
you pick the integration that fits your platform.
