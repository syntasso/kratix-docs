description: Use Kubernetes namespaces to isolate Kratix resource requests.
---

Kratix relies on Kubernetes namespaces for isolation. Every Promise-defined
request kind (for example `Database` or `App`) is namespaced, so each request
belongs to a namespace. This makes namespaces a natural boundary for teams,
individuals, environments, or organisations. You can combine namespaces with
Kubernetes features like ResourceQuotas to enforce limits and isolation.

Promises themselves are cluster-scoped and are not namespaced. That means a
Promise is visible across the cluster once installed. Use Kubernetes RBAC to
control who can list Promises and who can create request resources in each
namespace. See the Kratix [RBAC](/main/platform-concepts/auth/rbac) guide for
examples and guidance.

For the Kubernetes details, see the [Namespaces](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/) docs.
