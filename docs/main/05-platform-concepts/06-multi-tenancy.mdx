title: Multi-tenancy
description: Multi-tenancy for Kratix using standard Kubernetes isolation models.
---

Kratix does not introduce a custom multi-tenancy layer. Instead, it fits into
the same Kubernetes isolation patterns you already use. Depending on your
security and operational requirements, you can isolate tenants with separate
clusters, node pools, or namespaces.

Separate clusters are often used to reduce blast radius or to meet DR/HA or
regulatory requirements. Node pools help ensure workloads and workflows run on
the right type of compute (for example, dedicated, compliant, or GPU nodes).
Namespaces provide a lightweight boundary for teams. For example, an
organisation might allocate `backend` and `frontend` namespaces so each team can
manage their own Promise requests independently from the same Platform.

Most Kratix resource requests (for example `Database` or `App`) are namespaced,
so namespaces are a natural boundary for teams, environments, or organisations.
You can combine namespaces with Kubernetes features like ResourceQuotas and
NetworkPolicies to enforce limits and isolation.

Promises themselves are cluster-scoped and are not namespaced. That means a
Promise is visible across the cluster once installed. Use Kubernetes RBAC to
control who can list Promises and who can create request resources in each
namespace. See the Kratix [RBAC](/main/platform-concepts/auth/rbac) guide for
examples and guidance.

For the Kubernetes details, see the [Namespaces](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/) docs.
