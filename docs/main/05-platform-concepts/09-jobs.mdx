description: How Kratix workflows use Kubernetes Jobs.
---

Kratix workflows run as Kubernetes [Jobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/).
Each Pipeline in a Promise becomes a Job that Kubernetes executes to completion,
creating a Pod to run the workflow containers.

Jobs handle execution details such as retries and backoff. In Kratix, the Job
`backoffLimit` controls how many times a failed workflow is retried before it
is marked as failed. You can set `backoffLimit` on a Pipeline or configure
defaults in the [Kratix config](/main/reference/kratix-config/config). See the
[Workflows reference](/main/reference/workflows) for where those settings apply.

Common signals and what they usually mean:
- Job pods restarting and `STATUS` shows `CrashLoopBackOff`: a container in the
  Pipeline is failing, and Kubernetes is retrying it up to `backoffLimit`.
  Example:
  ```
  kubectl -n kratix-platform-system get pods
  NAME                                    READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
  workflow-abc123-9wq5k                   0/1     CrashLoopBackOff   3          4m
  ```
- Job completes but the workflow is marked failed: retries were exhausted and
  the Job hit `backoffLimit`. Example:
  ```
  kubectl -n kratix-platform-system get jobs
  NAME                  COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
  workflow-abc123       0/1           2m12s      6m
  ```
  ```
  kubectl -n kratix-platform-system describe job workflow-abc123
  ...
  BackoffLimitExceeded
  ```
- Job stays pending and no Pod is created: Kubernetes cannot schedule the Pod,
  often due to image pull failures or missing `imagePullSecrets`. Example:
  ```
  kubectl -n kratix-platform-system get pods
  NAME                                    READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
  workflow-abc123-9wq5k                   0/1     ErrImagePull       0          2m
  ```
