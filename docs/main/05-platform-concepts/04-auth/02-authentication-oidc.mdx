description: How Kratix authentication and authorization are handled.
---

Kratix does not implement its own authentication or authorization system. All
Kratix operations go through the Kubernetes API, so the cluster's authentication
and authorization policies apply automatically.

## Authentication

Kratix uses the same authentication mechanisms configured for your Kubernetes
API server, such as client certificates, bearer tokens, or OIDC. If you enable
OIDC on the API server, Kratix inherits those identities and group memberships
without additional configuration. Other common options include webhook
authentication and authentication proxies in front of the API server.

Refer to the Kubernetes documentation for details on configuring
[authentication](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/)
and [OIDC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#openid-connect-tokens).

## Authorization

Once authenticated, access to Kratix resources is controlled by Kubernetes
RBAC. This includes Promises, Promise-installed CRDs, and Kratix control-plane
objects. For examples and guidance on defining roles, see
[Role Based Access Control (RBAC)](/main/platform-concepts/auth/rbac).

## Why this matters

Kratix models platform operations as Kubernetes resources and workflows. Because
every action is a Kubernetes API call, you can use the same cluster-wide authn
and authz approach for Kratix that you already use for other workloads.
