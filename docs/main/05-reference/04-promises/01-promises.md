# Promises

Conceptually, Kratix Promises are the building blocks that enable teams to design
platforms that specifically meet their customer needs.

Technically, a Promise is a YAML document that defines a contract between the Platform and its users.

## Use Case

Consider the task of setting up development environments for application teams.
This task is usually repetitive and requires many cookie-cutter steps. It may
involve wiring up Git repos, spinning up a CI/CD server, creating a PaaS to run
the applications, instructing CI/CD to listen to the Git repos and push
successful builds into the PaaS, and finally wiring applications to their
required data services.

A Promise can encapsulate all the required steps and handle the toil of running
those low-level tasks. It can be designed as a single Promise that does it all,
or it can be a collection of Promises that, combined, deliver the desired
functionality.

## Benefits

Promises:

- enable you to build your platform incrementally and in response to the needs
  of your users.
- codify the contract between platform teams and application teams for the
  delivery of a specific service, e.g. a database, an identity service, a
  supply chain, or a complete development pipeline of patterns and tools.
- are easy to build, deploy, and update.
- are shareable and reusable between platforms, teams, business units, and other
  organisations.
- add up to a frictionless experience when platform users want to create
  services that they need to deliver value.

To see Promises in-action, check out the guides: [Installing a Promise](../../guides/installing-a-promise) and [Writing a Promise](../../guides/writing-a-promise).

  # Check the scheduling docs for details
  destinationSelectors:
    - matchLabels:
        # Arbitrary key/value pairs that will be used for scheduling
        key: value

  # Array of Kubernetes resources to be scheduled to matching Workers
