# Status

As part of your `configure` Pipeline you can optionally send information about the Resource
back to the resource requester by writing information to
`/kratix/metadata/status.yaml`. The file can contain arbitrary key values, with the
`message` key being a special key that is communicated back to the user when
running `kubectl get <resource-request>`. For example if the Pipeline container wrote the
following to the `/kratix/metadata/status.yaml` file:

```yaml
message: Resource provisioned with database size 10Gb
connectionDetails:
  host: example.com
  dbName: root
```

Kratix would pickup the status and apply it back to the Resource. The
user would see the following when using `kubectl` to `get` the Resource details:

```shell
kubectl get database
NAME                   STATUS
example                Resource provisioned with database size 10Gb
```

And if the requester inspected the full status output using `kubectl get database example -o yaml`, they would see all additional status keys:

```yaml
apiVersion: example.promise.syntasso.io/v1
kind: Database
# ...
status:
  message: Resource provisioned with database size 10Gb
  connectionDetails:
    host: example.com
    dbName: root
```

Status provides a simple way to communicate information back to the resource
requester. Kratix will automatically inject the required fields for status into
the `api`, you do not have to manually add these fields.

Status can also be used as a method of communicating information back to the
`delete` pipeline, such as the name of any external resources imperatively
created in the pipeline that need to be deleted as part of the delete pipeline

## Conditions

Kratix follows the Kubernetes convention of using
[conditions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#container-states)
to convey the status of a resource and to allow programmatic interactions. When
a Resource is requested the `PipelineCompleted` condition will be set. The
`status` for the Pipeline will be `False` until the Pipeline is completed. For
example when a Resource is requested for the first time the status will
look like:

```yaml
status:
  conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2023-03-07T15:50:22Z"
      message: Pipeline has not completed
      reason: PipelineNotCompleted
      status: "False"
      type: PipelineCompleted
```

once the Pipeline has been completed it will look like:

```yaml
status:
  conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2023-03-07T15:50:30Z"
      message: Pipeline completed
      reason: PipelineExecutedSuccessfully
      status: "True"
      type: PipelineCompleted
```

Conditions can be used by external systems to programmatically check when a
Resource Workflow has been completed. `kubectl` also has built-in support
for waiting for a condition to be met. For example after requesting a Resource
a user can run the following to have the CLI wait for the Workflow to be
completed:

```
kubectl wait redis/example --for=condition=PipelineCompleted --timeout=60s
```

Once the condition is `True` the command will exit.
