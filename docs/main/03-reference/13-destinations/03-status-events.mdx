Kratix follows the Kubernetes convention of using status conditions and events to report Destination health.
Destinations are considered ready when Kratix can write test documents to the backing State Store.

## Conditions

Destinations expose a `Ready` condition that reflects the latest health check:

- `TestDocumentsWritten` – test documents were written to the State Store successfully.
- `ReconciledSuccessfully` – init workloads are disabled, so no test documents are written.
- `StateStoreWriteFailed` – Kratix could not write the test documents.

The test documents include `dependencies/kratix-canary-namespace.yaml` and `resources/kratix-canary-configmap.yaml`.
When the `Ready` condition is `True` and a worker cluster is reconciling the Destination, you will see a
`kratix-worker-system` namespace and a `kratix-info` configmap on the target cluster.

Example:

```
$ kubectl describe destinations.platform.kratix.io worker-1
Name:         worker-1
...
Status:
  Conditions:
    Last Transition Time:  2025-03-04T15:26:21Z
    Message:               Test documents written to State Store
    Reason:                TestDocumentsWritten
    Status:                True
    Type:                  Ready
```

## Events

Destinations emit the following events:

- `DestinationReady` (`Normal`) – the Destination is ready. If init workloads are disabled, the message notes that
  no init workloads were written.
- `DestinationNotReady` (`Warning`) – writing test documents failed; the message includes the error.

Inspect events with:

```
kubectl describe destinations.platform.kratix.io <name>
```
