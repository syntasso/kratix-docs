description: Documentation for writing Resource Workflows using Kratix Pipelines, covering how Kratix internally executes the Pipeline containers

sidebar_label: Workflows
id: workflows
---

A Kratix Promise may contain workflow definitions for hooking into the lifecycle of any
Resource Requests made against the Promise.

Kratix supports two Resource workflow types: `configure` and `delete`.

- The `configure` workflow runs when the Resource is created, updated or reconciled, or
  when the parent Promise is updated.
- The `delete` workflow runs when the Resource is deleted.

Kratix workflows are made up of one or more Pipelines.

- The `configure` workflow may contain multiple Pipelines, which are executed serially.
- The `delete` workflow can only contain a single Pipeline.

Refer to the [Workflows documentation](../workflows) for detailed information on **how to
write Kratix Pipelines**.

To define Resource workflows inside a Promise, use `spec.workflows.resource` in the
Promise definition as shown below.

```yaml
platform: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: Promise
metadata:
  ...
spec:
  ...
  workflows:
    resource:
      configure:
        - # Pipeline definitions (multiple)
      delete:
        - # Pipeline definition (single)
```


## Configure Workflows

The `configure` workflow runs when the Resource is created, updated or reconciled, or
when the parent Promise is updated.

### Multiple Pipelines

Resource Configure workflows allow for **multiple** Pipelines to be executed in
sequence.

This enables step-by-step configuration of declarative state, as each Pipeline
ends by writing its output to the Kratix State Store. This means each Pipeline can depend
upon state declared during all previous Pipelines.

Within each Pipeline, an array of containers are defined, which will also execute in
sequence.

:::info

For simple cases, a single Pipeline with one or many containers will suffice.

The example below shows how a `resource.configure` workflow can be defined:

```yaml
platform: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: Promise
metadata:
  ...
spec:
  ...
  workflows:
    resource:
      configure:
        - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
          kind: Pipeline
          metadata:
            name: pipeline-a # Executes first
            namespace: default
          spec:
            ...
        - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
          kind: Pipeline
          metadata:
            name: pipeline-b # Follows pipeline-a
            namespace: default
          spec:
            ...
```

In this example, `pipeline-a` will run first, followed by `pipeline-b`.

### Pipeline Failures

A Pipeline fails if any of its `containers` return a non-zero exit code.

If this occurs, the workflow **halts**: no further containers are executed within the
Pipeline, and no further Pipelines are executed in the workflow.

To re-run a workflow following a Pipeline failure, you can perform a
[manual reconciliation](#manual-reconciliation) of the Resource, which will trigger the
workflow again from the beginning.

### Idempotency

All commands which run in Configure workflows must be idempotent, as there is a guarantee
that they will be run multiple times a day, and may be run much more frequently depending
on other environmental impacts (e.g. Pod restarts).

The `resource.configure` workflow is regularly executed. Kubernetes reconciles on a number
different actions, including, but not limited to:

- Resource creation
- Regular interval (10 hours, not currently configurable)
- Kratix Controller restarts
- Changes to the Resource definition
- Changes to the Promise definition

### Manual Reconciliation

Sometimes you may wish to manually trigger a Configure workflow for a specific Resource
Request.

In addition to the standard triggers outlined above, a Resource Request can be manually
triggered for reconciliation by labelling it as follows:

```yaml
kratix.io/manual-reconciliation: "true"
```

This will trigger the Resource Configure workflow to run.

This workflow instance will terminate any in-progress Resource Configure workflow and
start again from the first Pipeline.

Once Kratix schedules the manual workflow, the label will be removed, allowing you to add
it again for any additional manual runs.

See below for an example command to trigger a manual reconciliation of a `redis` Resource.

```
kubectl label redis my-redis-example kratix.io/manual-reconciliation=true
```

## Delete Workflows

Resource Delete workflows are triggered when a Resource is deleted, and currently only
support a **single** Pipeline.

This Pipeline is responsible for cleaning up resources and configurations that were set up
by the `resource.configure` workflow.

The example below shows how a `resource.delete` workflow can be defined.

```yaml
platform: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: Promise
metadata:
  ...
spec:
  ...
  workflows:
    resource:
      delete:
        - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
          kind: Pipeline
          metadata:
            name: delete-pipeline # Single pipeline
          spec:
            containers:
              ...
```

### Pipeline Failures

Kratix will trigger the Delete Pipeline exactly once.

If a command fails during container execution, this must be handled **within the container
itself** (including any retry attempts).

Kratix will not automatically reschedule/retry any Pipelines which have failed as part of a Delete
workflow.

### Manual Reconciliation

After a Resource Request has been marked for deletion, you can manually trigger
the Delete workflow (e.g. to re-run the workflow after a pipeline failure) by
labelling it as follows:

```yaml
kratix.io/manual-reconciliation: "true"
```

The Resource Delete workflow will re-run immediately, terminating any other
workflow that may be in progress.

Once Kratix schedules the manual workflow, the label will be removed, allowing
you to add it again for any additional manual runs.

See below for an example command to trigger a manual reconciliation of a `redis` Resource.

```
kubectl label redis my-redis-example kratix.io/manual-reconciliation=true
```
