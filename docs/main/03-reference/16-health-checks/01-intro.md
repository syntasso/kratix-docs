A [Kratix Promise](../promises/intro) can include health checks to ensure the provisioned resource meets the definition of healthy for the Promised Service.

Imagine you have written a Promise that provisions a service that can be accessed via a HTTP endpoint. For each provisioned service, you want to ensure that the endpoint is up and running. Health checks provide a mechanism for you to validate that your provisioned resource is healthy.

For further information, check out the [Health Definition](./healthdefinition) and [Health Record](./healthrecord) documentation.
