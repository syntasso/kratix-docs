description: Using Custom GitOps Agent

If you do not wish to use Flux or ArgoCD, you can use any tool that can apply
Kubernetes manifests declared in the state store to your cluster. Kratix will
populate two separate directories, `resources/` and `dependencies/` within the
directory of the Destination in the state store. The two directories should be
reconciled independently.

An example of a custom GitOps approach would be to configure two separate CI
pipeline to watch separate directories in the state store repository for changes
and apply the manifests to the cluster. This approach loses some of the benefits
of using a dedicated GitOps tool, such as automatic drift detection and
reconciliation, but may be a good fit for when you already have a CI pipeline in
place or where more established GitOps tools are not applicable.

If you choose to use a custom GitOps agent with Kratix, we'd love to hear about
it! Please reach out to us via the [contact us
page](/main/community) to share your experience and help us improve Kratix.
