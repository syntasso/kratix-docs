Flux can be used as the GitOps agent for Kratix. This guide will show you how to
install Flux to sync Kubernetes resources from your state store to your cluster.

## Installing Flux

If you have already installed Flux you can skip this section.

For the most up to date information on installing Flux, see the [Flux
documentation](https://fluxcd.io/docs/installation/). The simplest method of
installaton is to use the latest FluxCD release manifest from the Flux repo on
GitHub:

```bash
kubectl --context $WORKER apply -f https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/latest/download/install.yaml
```

If you wish to install a different way (e.g. Helm or CLI), or want to install a specific version,
follow the instructions in the [Flux documentation](https://fluxcd.io/docs/installation/).

Make sure that `flux` is ready before proceeding:

```shell-session
$ kubectl --context $WORKER get pods --namespace flux-system
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
helm-controller-5f7457c9dd-s5qzt           1/1     Running   0          18s
kustomize-controller-5f58d55f76-hwm5w      1/1     Running   0          19s
notification-controller-685bdc466d-5xmk8   1/1     Running   0          16s
source-controller-86b8b57796-t6xgg         1/1     Running   0          20s
```

## Configuring Flux
### Configuring access to the State Store
In order for FluxCD to be able to sync resources to your cluster you need to provide
FluxCD access to read from your state store. This can be done by creating a `Bucket` or `GitRepository`
resource depending on the type of state store you are using.

<Tabs className="boxedTabs" groupId="stateStore">

  <TabItem value="minio" label="Bucket (on KinD)">

    Create a `flux-statestore.yaml` for giving Flux access to the Minio
    bucket. Below is an example of a `Bucket` configured to talk to a MinIO
    instance running locally. For more information on the different
    configuration and authentication opitions for the `Bucket` resource, see the
    [FluxCD docs](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/buckets/).

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1
    kind: Bucket
    metadata:
      name: <state store name>
      namespace: flux-system
    spec:
      interval: 10s
      provider: generic
      bucketName: kratix
      endpoint: 172.18.0.2:31337
      insecure: true
      secretRef:
	name: minio-credentials
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: minio-credentials
      namespace: default
    type: Opaque
    stringData:
      accesskey: <access key>
      secretkey: <secret key>
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="git" label="Git Repository">

    Create a `flux-statestore.yaml` for giving Flux access to the Git
    Repository. Below is an example of a `GitRepository` configured to talk to
    GitHub repo. For more information on the different configuration and
    authentication opitions for the `GitRepository` resource, see the [FluxCD
    docs](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/gitrepositories/).

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
    kind: GitRepository
    metadata:
      name: podinfo
      namespace: default
    spec:
      interval: 10s
      url: https://github.com/syntasso/worker-destination
      ref:
	branch: main
      secretRef:
        name: git-credentials
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
    name: ssh-credentials
    type: Opaque
    stringData:
    identity: |
      -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
      ...
      -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
    known_hosts: |
      github.com ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAA...
    ```
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

Install the `flux-statestore.yaml` resources to the worker cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply --context $WORKER -f flux-statestore.yaml
```

### Configuring Flux to deploy resources from the State Store

Now that Flux is configured to read from the state store, you need to configure
Flux to read the resources from the state store and apply them to the cluster.
This is done by creating a `Kustomization` resources. Kratix creates two, one
for the dependencies (documents from the Promise Dependencies or Promise
Configure Workflow) and one for the resources (documents from the Resource
Configure Workflow).

Create a `kustomization.yaml` file with the following content, substituting the values
for the `sourceRef` depending on which type of state store you are using.

The `path` field should point to the directory in the state store where the
resources/dependencies are getting written to. By default this is the
`./<destination-name>/resources` and `./<destination-name>/dependencies`
directories. If you are configuring more advanced setups, you may need to change
this path, see [Destination documentation](../reference/destinations/intro)
for more information.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: kratix-workload-resources
  namespace: <Same namespace as the Bucket/GitRepository>
spec:
  interval: 3s
  prune: true
  dependsOn:
    - name: kratix-workload-dependencies
  sourceRef:
    kind: <Bucket or GitRepository>
    name: <Name of Bucket/GitRepository>
  path: ./<path in state store to destination>/resources
  validation: client
---
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: kratix-workload-dependencies
  namespace: <Same namespace as the Bucket/GitRepository>
spec:
  interval: 8s
  prune: true
  sourceRef:
    kind: <Bucket or GitRepository>
    name: <Name of Bucket/GitRepository>
  path: ./<path in state store to destination>/dependencies
  validation: client
```

Once filled in with the correct values, apply the resource to the worker
cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply --context $WORKER -f kustomization.yaml
```

To check that Flux is correctly syncing resources from the state store to the
cluster you can check the health of the Kustomization resources:

```shell-session
kubectl --context $WORKER get kustomizations -A -w
```

You should see the `kratix-workload-resources` and `kratix-workload-dependencies`
resources eventually get in the `Ready` state.
```
