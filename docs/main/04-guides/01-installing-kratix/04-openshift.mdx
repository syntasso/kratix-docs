## Set up Platform Cluster {#platform-setup}

If you are not using a pre-existing cluster, create your Platform Cluster using
your OpenShift console. Then login to the cluster using the `oc` cli and run the
following to export the `PLATFORM` environment variable:

```bash
kubectl config current-context
export PLATFORM=<platform-context-name>
```

Kratix docker images are hosted on the `syntasso.docker.scarf.sh` registry, ensure you've
configured your cluster to [allow access to the registry](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.17/openshift_images/image-configuration.html).

:::warning

Some users have reported issues with accessing the
`syntasso.docker.scarf.sh` registry even after adding it as a supported registry:
```
kubectl -n kratix-platform-system get pods
NAME                                                 READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
kratix-platform-controller-manager-7698bb84d-82dfm   0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          95s
minio-54f847c6c5-4t9jb                               1/1     Running            0          93s

kubectl -n kratix-platform-system describe pod kratix-platform-controller-manager-7698bb84d-82dfm
...
Failed to pull image "syntasso.docker.scarf.sh/syntasso/kratix-platform": fetching target platform image selected from image index: reading manifest sha256:... in syntasso.docker.scarf.sh/syntasso/kratix-platform: received unexpected HTTP status: 500 Internal Server Error
```

If this event occurs, we recommend one of the following actions:

1. Use the Docker Hub Registry instead. Update the image references from `syntasso.docker.scarf.sh/syntasso` to `syntasso`.
1. Host Images in your own registry. Push the images to your own container registry and update references accordingly.

The image references need to be updated in the following locations:
  - The `kratix-platform-controller-manager` deployment in the `kratix-platform-system` namespace.
  - The `kratix-platform-pipeline-adapter-config` ConfigMap in the `kratix-platform-system` namespace.

## Set up Destination {#worker-setup}

If you are not using a pre-existing cluster, create a Worker Cluster following
the same steps as the [Platform Cluster setup](#platform-setup).

Once completed, log in to your cluster using the `oc` cli and set the `WORKER` environment
variable:

```bash
kubectl config current-context
export WORKER=<worker-context-name>
```

:::tip

Some GitOps Agents may require additional configuration to work with OpenShift.
Please check the documentation for your specific GitOps Agent for any additional
steps.
