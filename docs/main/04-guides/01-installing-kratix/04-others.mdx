## System setup

This guide will show how to use Kratix on two Kubernetes clusters. Install the prerequisites
listed below if they aren't already on your system. If you are using pre-existing clusters
or want to use a different tool to provision your clusters, skip requirements 1 and 2.

1. `kind` CLI / **Kubernetes-in-Docker (KinD)**:
   Used to create and manage local Kubernetes clusters in Docker. See [the quick start guide](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) to install.
2. `docker` CLI / **Docker**:
   Used to orchestrate containers. `kind` (above) requires that you have Docker installed and configured. See [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install.
3. `kubectl` / **Kubernetes command-line tool**:
   The CLI for Kubernetes â€” allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. See [the install guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl).

:::tip

To get setup locally quickly with KinD clusters you can use the `./scripts/quick-start.sh`
from the root of the [Kratix repository](https://github.com/syntasso/kratix). This provisions
an in-cluster `MinIO` to use as the backing [State Store](/main/reference/statestore/intro).
Alternatively you can provide the `--git` flag to create it with an in-cluster Gitea
instance instead.

## Set up platform cluster {#platform-setup}

If you are not using a pre-existing cluster, create your platform cluster locally using KinD:
```bash
kind create cluster --image kindest/node:v1.27.3 --name platform
# set PLATFORM to point to the platform cluster context
export PLATFORM="kind-platform"
```
