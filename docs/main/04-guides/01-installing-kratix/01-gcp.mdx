## Set up platform cluster {#platform-setup}

If you are not using a pre-existing cluster, create your platform cluster by
following the GKE getting started docs [here](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/kubernetes-engine-overview) 

Once completed login to your cluster using and set the `PLATFORM` environment
variable:

```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster-name> --zone <zone> --project <project-name>
export PLATFORM=<cluster-name>
```


<PartialInstallKratixAndCert />

<PartialInstallStateStoreStart />

If you have a pre-existing Git repository or S3-Compatible Bucket you can use that as your
state store. If not you can either:

- Create a new Git repository on your Git provider of choice and use it as your state
  store. See [Git State Store](/main/reference/statestore/gitstatestore) for
  more information.
- Create a [GCP Bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets)
  (anything that implements the S3 API will work) and then use it as your state
  store. See [Bucket State Store](/main/reference/statestore/bucketstatestore)
  for more information. You will have to create a set of [S3-Compatible
  credentials](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/interoperability) for
  Kratix to use.


## Set up worker cluster {#worker-setup}

If you are not using a pre-existing cluster, create a worker cluster following
the same steps as [platform cluster setup](#platform-setup).

Once completed login to your cluster using and set the `WORKER` environment
variable:

```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster-name> --zone <zone> --project <project-name>
export WORKER=<cluster-name>
```

<PartialInstalConfigureFluxAndRegisterDestination/>

<PartialCheckFluxAndFinish />
