Kratix Promises provide a means of providing Anything-as-a-Service. The Promise API equips users with the ability to tailor a given service to their needs, essential business rules can be embedded within Promise workflows and the continuous reconciliation of resources helps ensure resources are kept up-to-date.

For Platform Teams and Promise writers, the Promise also serves as a way to perform upgrades to a fleet a fleet of resources. Upgrades can take many forms, be they upgrades to the API determining how users provision their services, updated to the Dependencies used by a Promise or updates to Promise Workflows.

## Updating the API

When introducing changes to Promise API, it is essential to ensure that the changes are backwards-compatible. For instance, when a Resource Configure workflow runs for the 
updated Promise, it should not fail because of a newly introduced change to the API.

Lets say we have an `app` promise, and want to introduce the ability to configure a database. When selecting a database. consumers will be able to configure a size of `small`, `medium` or `large`.
