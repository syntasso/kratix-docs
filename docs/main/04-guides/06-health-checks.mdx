## The Health Status

Within the resource `status`, Kratix understands the `healthStatus` field. In this field, Promise writers can describe the health of the resource. The field has the following format:

```yaml
status:
  healthStatus:
    state: healthy
    healthRecords:
    - state: healthy
      lastRun: 1531958400
      details:
        readyReplicas: 2
      source:
        name: healthrecord-example
        namespace: default
```

The `healthStatus` field contains a `state` subfield and a list of `healthRecords`. The `state` subfield indicates the overall health of the resource and is calculated from the state of each of the `healthRecords`.

The `healthRecords` list contains detailed health information about each of the checks against the resource.

The `state` subfield can have the following values:

* ready: the resource is ready to use
* healthy: the resource is healthy
* unknown: used to indicate that the state is not known
* degraded: the resource is operational, but its functionality may be affected
* unhealthy: the resource is unhealthy and should be investigated

The healthStatus state will be determined by the least desirable state of the health records. For example, if one health record is `unhealthy` and another is `healthy`, the overall state will be `unhealthy`.

| HealthRecord 1                       | HealthRecord 2                                                                       | HealthStatus         |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Ready  | Healthy                                   | Healthy |
| **Promise Delete**     | The Promise is deleted                                                           | Single                      |
| **Resource Configure** | The Resource is created, updated or reconciled, or the parent Promise is updated | Multiple, executed serially |
| **Resource Delete**    | The Resource is deleted                                                          | Single                      |


The `lastRun` field is a timestamp indicating the time the Health Check was last run. The timestamp is in seconds since the epoch.

The `details` field is an optional field that can be used to provide additional details about the Health Check. The details are free-form and can be used to provide any information that may be relevant to the Health Check.

## The HealthRecord CRD

Promise writers can use `/kratix/metadata/status.yaml` to populate the `healthRecord` status field. Alternatively, they can write a HealthRecord CR and schedule it to the Platform cluster in their Pipelines.

A HealthRecord details the result of a Health check. When a Health Record exists for a given Resource, Kratix will update the referenced resource status to reflect the data in the HealthRecord. It has the following format:

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: HealthRecord
metadata:
  name: healthrecord-example
data:
  promiseRef:
    name: promise-name
  # A reference to the Resource Request the Health Check should be performed against  
  resourceRef:
    name: request-name
    namespace: default
  # The condition of the Health Check
  #Â Can be unknown, ready, unhealthy, healthy or degraded
  state: ready
  # The timestamp of the last time the Heath Check was executed
  lastRun: 1531958400
  # Optional: any additional details
  details:
    example: data
```

:::tip

You can have extenal systems generating the HealthRecord CR and, via GitOps, continuously updating the health information of the resources in your Platform.

:::

## Writing a HealthRecord in a Workflow

Now that you understand the `healthRecord` status and the HealthRecord CRD, let's see how to use them in a Workflow. For that, you will update the Redis Promise you can find in the Marketplace. Start by downloading the Promise YAML to your local machine:

```bash
curl -Lo redis-promise.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/main/redis/promise.yaml
```

You are going to update the promise as follows:

* The first workflow in `resource.configure` will instantiate the Redis Promise. You will update it to also generate the HealthRecord.
* The second workflow will wait for the resource status `healthRecord.state` to be equal to `healthy`.

### The HealthRecord generator workflow

To update the first workflow to also generate a HealthRecord, you will need to add a new container to the Workflow. This new container will apply a HealthRecord directly to the Platform cluster.

:::tip

In this guide, we will use the `kubectl` CLI to apply the HealthRecord directly. You could, instead, use the Kratix Workflow output directory and schedule it to the Platform cluster. See [Compound Promise](./compound-promises) for more details.

:::

The script will look like this:

```bash
namespace="$(yq '.metadata.namespace // "default"' /kratix/input/object.yaml)"
resourceName="$(yq '.metadata.name' /kratix/input/object.yaml)"

cat <<EOF > health-record.yaml
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: HealthRecord
metadata:
  name: redis-${resourceName}
  namespace: ${namespace}
data:
  promiseRef:
    name: redis
  resourceRef:
    name: ${resourceName}
    namespace: ${namespace}
  state: unhealthy
  lastRun: $(date +%s)
  details:
    example: some-detail
EOF

kubectl apply --filename health-record.yaml
```

This script is available in the `ghcr.io/kratix-docs/redis-health-checks:v0.1.0` image as `generate-hr`.

:::tip

For simplicity, we will not execute any real check to verify the health status of the Redis instance. Instead, we will simply generate a HealthRecord with an `unhealthy` state (we will later update it to `healthy` to illustrate the concept). In your use case, you may want to run some actual verification steps to assert the status of the created resource.

:::

Since this workflow is using `kubectl` to apply the HealthRecord, you must ensure that the right RBAC settings are defined in the promise.

Update your Promise to include the new container and the RBAC configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: Promise
metadata:
  name: redis
  labels:
    kratix.io/promise-version: v0.1.0
spec:
  api: # omitted for brevity
  workflows:
    resource:
      configure:
        - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
          kind: Pipeline
          metadata:
            name: instance-configure
          spec:
            #highlight-start
            rbac:
              permissions:
                - apiGroups: ["platform.kratix.io"]
                  resources: ["healthrecords"]
                  verbs: ["get", "list", "create", "update", "patch"]
            #highlight-end
            containers:
              - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/redis-configure-pipeline:v0.1.0
                name: redis-configure-pipeline
              #highlight-start
              - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/kratix-docs/redis-health-checks:v0.1.0
                name: generate-healthrecord
                command: [ "generate-hr" ]
              #highlight-end
    promise: # omitted for brevity
```

:::warning

Make sure you add the container to the correct location in the Promise. The container needs to be added to the `resource.configure` section, so that it is executed when a Resource Request is applied.

:::

### The HealthRecord waiting workflow

Next, you will add a second workflow to wait for the resource to be healthy. The code will look like this:

```bash
namespace="$(yq '.metadata.namespace // "default"' /kratix/input/object.yaml)"
resourceName="$(yq '.metadata.name' /kratix/input/object.yaml)"

while true; do
  state="$(kubectl get redis ${resourceName} --namespace ${namespace} -o jsonpath='{.status.healthRecord.state}')"
  if [[ ${state} == "healthy" ]]; then 
    break
  fi
  echo "Waiting for resource to be healthy, current state: ${state:-"unknown"}"
  sleep 5
done

echo "Resource is healthy"
```

This script is available in the `ghcr.io/kratix-docs/redis-health-checks:v0.1.0` image in the `wait-healthy` binary.

Update the Promise with a new workflow executing this container:

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: Promise
metadata:
  name: redis
  labels:
    kratix.io/promise-version: v0.1.0
spec:
  api: # omitted for brevity
  workflows:
    resource:
      configure:
        - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
          kind: Pipeline
          metadata:
            name: instance-configure
          spec:
            rbac:
              permissions:
                - apiGroups: ["platform.kratix.io"]
                  resources: ["healthrecords"]
                  verbs: ["get", "list", "create", "update", "patch"]
            containers:
              - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/redis-configure-pipeline:v0.1.0
                name: redis-configure-pipeline
              - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/kratix-docs/redis-health-checks:v0.1.0
                name: generate-healthrecord
                command: [ "generate-hr" ]
        #highlight-start
        - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
          kind: Pipeline
          metadata:
            name: wait-status
          spec:
            containers:
              - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/kratix-docs/redis-health-checks:v0.1.0
                name: wait-healthy
                command: [ "wait-healthy" ]
        #highlight-end
    promise: # omitted for brevity
```

## Applying the Promise

With the changes above, you can apply the Promise:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM apply -f redis-promise.yaml
```

Create a new Redis instance:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/main/redis/resource-request.yaml
```

## Verifying the results

You can now watch the workflow execution. The first workflow runs and generate a HealthRecord with the `unhealthy` state. The second workflow starts and waits for the resource to be healthy. You can check the workflows:

```bash
$ kubectl --context $PLATFORM get pods
NAME                                                  READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
kratix-redis-example-instance-configure-3c020-5xxpc   0/1     Completed   0          13s
kratix-redis-example-wait-status-13b3f-2s7q7          0/1     Init:1/3    0          6s
```

If you check the logs for the second workflow:

```bash
$ kubectl --context $PLATFORM logs kratix-redis-example-wait-status-13b3f-2s7q7 -c wait-healthy
Waiting for resource to be healthy, current state: unhealthy
Waiting for resource to be healthy, current state: unhealthy
Waiting for resource to be healthy, current state: unhealthy
Waiting for resource to be healthy, current state: unhealthy
...
```

You can also check the HealthRecords:

```bash
$ kubectl --context $PLATFORM get healthrecords redis-example -oyaml
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
data:
  details:
    example: some-detail
  lastRun: 1737736375
  promiseRef:
    name: redis
  resourceRef:
    name: example
    namespace: default
  state: unhealthy
kind: HealthRecord
metadata:
  name: redis-example
  namespace: default
  # some details omitted for brevity
```

The Redis resource itself should also include the Record in its status:

```bash
$ kubectl --context $PLATFORM get redis.marketplace.kratix.io example -ojsonpath='{.status.healthRecord}'
{"details":{"example":"some-detail"},"lastRun":1737736375,"state":"unhealthy"}
```

Now edit the HealthRecord and mark it as `healthy`:

```bash
kubectl patch healthrecord redis-example --patch '{"data":{"state":"healthy"}}' --type=merge
```

If you check the workflow pods now, you should see the second workflow completed (it may take a couple of seconds):

```bash
$ kubectl --context $PLATFORM get pods
NAME                                                  READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
kratix-redis-example-instance-configure-3c020-5xxpc   0/1     Completed   0          1m20s
kratix-redis-example-wait-status-13b3f-2s7q7          0/1     Completed   0          1m10s
```

That means the Redis instance should now be reporting "healthy":

```bash
$ kubectl --context $PLATFORM get redis.marketplace.kratix.io example -ojsonpath='{.status.healthRecord}'
{"details":{"example":"some-detail"},"lastRun":1737736375,"state":"healthy"}
```

## Conclusion

HealthRecords offer a powerful way to directly surface health information about resources to platform users. They enable you to provide detailed insights into the state of your resources while signalling to the platform whether those resources are healthy or require attention.

By integrating with GitOps tools, HealthRecords can serve as an API for external systems to update resource health statuses dynamically. For instance, tools like Kuberhealthy can be used to generate HealthRecords, which can then be stored in a GitOps repository. This approach allows seamless integration with the platform cluster, enabling real-time health status updates and improving visibility and management of resource health.
