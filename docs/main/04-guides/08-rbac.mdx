Kratix leverages the Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system to
manage permissions and access control within the platform. RBAC allows
administrators to define roles and assign them to users or groups, specifying
what actions they can perform on various resources. To gain an understanding of
how Kubernetes RBAC works, please refer to the official Kubernetes documentation on
[RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/). This guide
assumes familiarity with Kubernetes RBAC concepts. If you are new to RBAC, it is
recommended to review the Kubernetes documentation before proceeding.

## RBAC in Kratix

Everything Kratix exposes is represented as a [Custom Resource Definition
(CRD)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)
in Kubernetes. Therefore to restrict access to Kratix functionality, you will
create Roles and RoleBindings (or ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings) that
reference these CRDs. The CRDs of note that come out of the box with Kratix are:

- [`Promise`](/main/reference/promises/intro) - The definition of a Service to
  be offered on the platform
- [`Work`](/main/learn-more/kratix-resources#output-objects) - The definition
  of the declarative workloads that need to be scheduled
- [`WorkPlacement`](/main/learn-more/kratix-resources#output-objects) - The
  defintion of a scheduled workload.
- [`GitStateStore`/`BucketStateStore`](/main/reference/statestore/intro) -
  Definitions of State Stores that Kratix can use to write declarative
  documents to.
- [`Destination`](/main/guides/new-destination) - Definitions of Destinations
  that Kratix can schedule workloads to.

All of the above CRDs are of note for the Platform Engineer, and generally are not ever
accessed by end users of the platform. Therefore, it is recommended to
restrict access to these CRDs to only Platform Engineers and trusted
automation.

Users of the platform will generally only need access to read Promises
to understand what Services are available to them, and resource requests to
the CRD that represents the Service being offered (e.g. `Database` CRD for the
Database Promises). Therefore, it is recommended to create Roles and
RoleBindings that only allow access to these resources for end users of the
platform.
