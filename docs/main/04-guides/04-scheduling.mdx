description: Guide on how to register a new Destination with Kratix
title: Adding a new Destination
---

One of the most powerful features of Kratix is its ability to react when new Destinations are added to the platform. These Destinations can represent additional Kubernetes clusters, Kubernetes namespaces, or completely different infrastructure like a Terraform Cloud account or edge compute provider. By default, any Promise installed into Kratix will schedule it's Dependencies to new Destinations joining the platform.

## Prerequisites

In this section, we will register a new Kubernetes cluster as a Destination with Kratix, and
experience the Kratix multi-cluster capabilities. Before continuing, you will need a Platform
Kubernetes cluster running Kratix, and a second worker Kubernetes cluster to
register with the Platform. You also need at least one Promise installed on
the Platform.

For the context of this guide, we will assume the setup from [Installing Kratix
with KinD](./installing-kratix-others) and that the following environment variables are
set:

```bash
export PLATFORM="kind-platform"
export WORKER="kind-worker"
```

We will also use the [Jenkins
Promise](https://github.com/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/tree/main/jenkins) as an
example. Follow [Installing a Promise](./installing-a-promise) to get Jenkins
installed, if needed.

```shell-session
$ kubectl --context $PLATFORM get destinations.platform.kratix.io
NAME               AGE
worker-1   1h

$ kubectl --context $PLATFORM get promises.platform.kratix.io
NAME              AGE
jenkins-promise   1h
```

On the worker, you should see the Jenkins Operator running:

```shell-session
$ kubectl --context $WORKER get pods
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
jenkins-operator-778d6fc487-gczpb   1/1     Running   0          1h
```

If your setup is different, update the commands accordingly.

## Preparing the new cluster

You will now add the new cluster to the Platform as a Destination and watch Kratix reconcile the
system. For that, you need to first create the new Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
kind create cluster --image kindest/node:v1.27.3 --name worker-2
export WORKER_2="kind-worker-2"
```

Next, install a GitOps Agent on the cluster. For local dev environments the
quickest way to do that is to run the `./scripts/install-gitops` script from the
Kratix root directory. If you want to do a proper installation with the GitOps
tools of your choice, check the [GitOps Agent installation
guide](/category/installing-gitops-agent).

```bash
cd /path/to/kratix
./scripts/install-gitops --context ${WORKER_2} --path worker-2
```

## Registering the Destination

You can now register your cluster with Kratix as a Destination. Create a file called `worker-2.yaml` with the
following contents:

```yaml title="worker-2.yaml"
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: Destination
metadata:
  name: worker-2
  labels:
    environment: dev
spec:
  path: worker-2
  stateStoreRef:
    name: default
    kind: BucketStateStore
```

The Destination will using the pre-existing MinIO [State Store](/main/reference/statestore/intro).
Apply the Destination document to the platform cluster:

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM apply --filename worker-2.yaml
```

Check the Destination was created:

```shell-session {4}
$ kubectl --context $PLATFORM get destinations.platform.kratix.io
NAME       AGE
worker-1   1h
worker-2   1h
```

Kratix will react to the new Destination by scheduling the Jenkins Promise
to the the correct bucket. After a couple of minutes, you should see the Jenkins Operator
deployed and running on the new worker cluster:

```shell-session {3}
$ kubectl --context ${WORKER_2} get pods
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
jenkins-operator-778d6fc487-c9w8f   1/1     Running   0          1h
```

When you request a new Jenkins, the Resources will be created in one of the available Destinations, by default this is selected in a non-deterministic way.

For further documentation on Destination scheduling, check the [Destination Reference
documentation](../reference/destinations/intro).
