A **Work** represents the output of a workflow. Each Work is scheduled to one or more Destinations and its progress is tracked through conditions. A **WorkPlacement** ties part of a Work to a specific Destination and records whether the documents were written successfully.

## Work Conditions

Works expose the following conditions:

- `ScheduleSucceeded` – set to `True` once all WorkPlacements have been created. If Kratix cannot find matching Destinations this condition is `False` with reason `UnscheduledWorkloadGroups`.
- `Ready` – becomes `True` when every WorkPlacement has been scheduled successfully.

Example output from `kubectl get work <name> -o yaml`:

```yaml
status:
  conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2025-06-23T14:03:20Z"
      message: All workplacements scheduled successfully
      reason: AllWorkplacementsScheduled
      status: "True"
      type: ScheduleSucceeded
    - lastTransitionTime: "2025-06-23T14:03:20Z"
      message: Ready
      reason: AllWorkplacementsScheduled
      status: "True"
      type: Ready
```

## WorkPlacement Conditions

A WorkPlacement records whether its documents were written to the Destination:

- `ScheduleSucceeded` – `True` when the WorkPlacement has been scheduled to a Destination.
- `WriteSucceeded` – indicates the documents were written to the State Store backing the Destination.
- `Ready` – `True` when the Destination accepted the documents.

Example output from `kubectl get workplacement <name> -o yaml`:

```yaml
status:
  conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2025-06-23T14:03:20Z"
      message: Scheduled to correct Destination
      reason: ScheduledToDestination
      status: "True"
      type: ScheduleSucceeded
    - lastTransitionTime: "2025-06-23T14:03:20Z"
      message: Ready
      reason: WorkloadsWrittenToTargetDestination
      status: "True"
      type: Ready
    - lastTransitionTime: "2025-06-23T14:03:20Z"
      message: ""
      reason: WorkloadsWrittenToStateStore
      status: "True"
      type: WriteSucceeded
```

## Events

Events on Works and WorkPlacements highlight scheduling progress and any issues writing to Destinations. Use:

```bash
kubectl describe work <name>
kubectl describe workplacement <name>
```

to inspect recent events.
