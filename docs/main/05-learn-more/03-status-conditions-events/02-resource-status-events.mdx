Kratix follows the Kubernetes convention of using status and events to convey the status of a Resource and to allow
programmatic interactions.

## Conditions

Resources have the following list of conditions:

- `ConfigureWorkflowCompleted` – all Configure workflow pipelines finished successfully.
- `WorksSucceeded` – every Work created for the Resource has completed.
- `Reconciled` – Resource has been successfully reconciled; set to true when all the above conditions are all true.

Example output:

```yaml
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-06-23T14:07:29Z"
    message: Pipelines completed
    reason: PipelinesExecutedSuccessfully
    status: "True"
    type: ConfigureWorkflowCompleted
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-06-23T14:07:32Z"
    message: Reconciled
    reason: Reconciled
    status: "True"
    type: Reconciled
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-06-23T14:03:24Z"
    message: All works associated with this resource are ready
    reason: WorksSucceeded
    status: "True"
    type: WorksSucceeded
  lastSuccessfulConfigureWorkflowTime: "2025-06-23T14:07:29Z"
```

## Last Successful ConfigureWorkflow

A Resource also records the time of the last successful Configure workflow run in `status.lastSuccessfulConfigureWorkflowTime`.

## Events

Events note important steps in the Resource lifecycle such as starting a workflow job or encountering errors.

Inspect them with:

```bash
kubectl describe <resource> <name>
```

Example Resource events:
```
kubectl describe <resource> <name>
...
Events:
  Type     Reason              Age                From                       Message
  ----     ------              ----               ----                       -------
  Normal   PipelineStarted     7m13s              ResourceRequestController  Configure Pipeline started: instance-configure
  Warning  WorksMisplaced      2m27s              ResourceRequestController  Some works associated with this resource are misplaced: [redis-example-instance-configure-b11aa]
  Normal   WorksSucceeded      8s (x2 over 7m9s)  ResourceRequestController  All works associated with this resource are ready
  Normal   ReconcileSucceeded  8s (x2 over 7m9s)  ResourceRequestController  Successfully reconciled
```

Successful events will be of type `Normal` whereas errors will be published as `Warning` events.
These events help in troubleshooting and understanding the status of your Resource requests.
