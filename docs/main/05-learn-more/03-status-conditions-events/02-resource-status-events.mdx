Resources expose progress information through status conditions. Common conditions include:

- `ConfigureWorkflowCompleted` – all Configure workflow pipelines finished successfully.
- `WorksSucceeded` – every Work created for the Resource completed without errors.
- `Reconciled` – the controller has observed the latest version of the Resource.

A Resource also records the time of the last successful configuration in `status.lastSuccessfulConfigureWorkflowTime`.

Example output:

```yaml
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-06-23T14:07:29Z"
    message: Pipelines completed
    reason: PipelinesExecutedSuccessfully
    status: "True"
    type: ConfigureWorkflowCompleted
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-06-23T14:07:32Z"
    message: Reconciled
    reason: Reconciled
    status: "True"
    type: Reconciled
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-06-23T14:03:24Z"
    message: All works associated with this resource are ready
    reason: WorksSucceeded
    status: "True"
    type: WorksSucceeded
  lastSuccessfulConfigureWorkflowTime: "2025-06-23T14:07:29Z"
```

## Events

Events note important steps in the Resource lifecycle such as starting a workflow job or encountering errors. Inspect them with:

```bash
kubectl describe <resource> <name>
```

These events help in troubleshooting and automation around Resource management.
