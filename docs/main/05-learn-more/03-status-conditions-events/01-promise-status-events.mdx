Kratix follows the Kubernetes convention of using status and events to convey important information about a Promise.
Promise Status describes what general condition the Promise is in and surfaces any error that has occurred.

## Conditions

A Promise exposes the following list of conditions:

- `RequirementsFulfilled` – Kratix has installed any required Promises declared by the Promise.
- `ConfigureWorkflowCompleted` – all configure workflow pipelines executed successfully.
- `WorksSucceeded` – all Works created for the Promise has completed.
- `Available` – Promise is ready to accept Resource requests.
- `Reconciled` – Promise has been successfully reconciled; set to true when all the above conditions are all true.

Example Promise conditions from `kubectl get promise <name> -o yaml`:

```yaml
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-06-23T14:02:27Z"
    message: Requirements fulfilled
    reason: RequirementsInstalled
    status: "True"
    type: RequirementsFulfilled
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-06-23T14:07:23Z"
    message: Pipelines completed
    reason: PipelinesExecutedSuccessfully
    status: "True"
    type: ConfigureWorkflowCompleted
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-06-23T14:02:40Z"
    message: All works associated with this promise are ready
    reason: WorksSucceeded
    status: "True"
    type: WorksSucceeded
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-06-23T14:07:26Z"
    message: Ready to fulfil resource requests
    reason: PromiseAvailable
    status: "True"
    type: Available
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-06-23T14:07:26Z"
    message: Reconciled
    reason: Reconciled
    status: "True"
    type: Reconciled
```

Inspect the current Promise status at any time with:

```bash
kubectl describe promise <name>
```

## Common Promise Status Fields

- `apiVersion` – Shows the API version that this Promise is serving requests at.
- `kind` – Shows the Kind that this Promise is serving.
- `lastAvailableTime` – When this Promise becomes available.
- `status` – Whether the Promise is ready to accept Resource requests; can be set to 'Available' or 'Unavailable'.
- `workflows` - The number of Resource configure workflow pipelines
- `workflowsSucceeded` - The number of Resource configure workflow pipelines that have completed successfully
- `workflowsFailed`- The number of Resource configure workflow pipelines that have failed

```yaml
status:
  apiVersion: test.kratix.io/v1alpha1
  kind: Redis
  lastAvailableTime: "2025-06-23T15:34:32Z"
  status: Available
  conditions:
  ...
```

## Events

Events record important moments in the Promise lifecycle such as when requirements are installed,
if the configure pipeline is running and when the Promise becomes available.

They can be viewed by running:

```
kubectl describe promise <name>
```

Example Promise events:
```bash
kubectl describe promise <name>
...
Events:
  Type    Reason                      Age                    From               Message
  ----    ------                      ----                   ----               -------
  Normal  PipelineStarted             7m53s                  PromiseController  Configure Pipeline started: promise-configure
  Normal  Available                   7m43s (x2 over 7m43s)  PromiseController  Promise is available
  Normal  WorksSucceeded              7m43s                  PromiseController  All works associated with this promise are ready
  Normal  ReconcileSucceeded          7m43s                  PromiseController  Successfully reconciled
  Normal  ConfigureWorkflowCompleted  7m38s (x2 over 7m43s)  PromiseController  All workflows completed
```

Successful events will be of type `Normal` whereas errors will be published as `Warning` events.
These events are useful for understanding the progression of the Promise and troubleshooting failures.
