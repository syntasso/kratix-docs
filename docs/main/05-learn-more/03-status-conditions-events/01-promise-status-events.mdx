Kratix tracks the lifecycle of each Promise using Kubernetes conditions and events. These describe what phase the Promise is in and surface any actions that may be required.

## Conditions

A Promise exposes several well known conditions:

- `RequirementsFulfilled` – Kratix has installed any prerequisites declared by the Promise.
- `ConfigureWorkflowCompleted` – all Configure workflow pipelines executed successfully.
- `WorksSucceeded` – every Work created for the Promise has completed.
- `Available` – the Promise is ready to accept Resource requests.
- `Reconciled` – the reconciler has observed the latest version of the Promise.

Example output from `kubectl get promise <name> -o yaml`:

```yaml
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-06-23T14:02:27Z"
    message: Requirements fulfilled
    reason: RequirementsInstalled
    status: "True"
    type: RequirementsFulfilled
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-06-23T14:07:23Z"
    message: Pipelines completed
    reason: PipelinesExecutedSuccessfully
    status: "True"
    type: ConfigureWorkflowCompleted
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-06-23T14:02:40Z"
    message: All works associated with this promise are ready
    reason: WorksSucceeded
    status: "True"
    type: WorksSucceeded
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-06-23T14:07:26Z"
    message: Ready to fulfil resource requests
    reason: PromiseAvailable
    status: "True"
    type: Available
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-06-23T14:07:26Z"
    message: Reconciled
    reason: Reconciled
    status: "True"
    type: Reconciled
```

Inspect the current status at any time with:

```bash
kubectl describe promise <name>
```

## Events

Events record important moments in the Promise lifecycle such as requirements installation, Work creation and when the Promise becomes available. They can be viewed using:

```bash
kubectl describe promise <name>
```

These events are useful for understanding the progression of the Promise and troubleshooting failures.
