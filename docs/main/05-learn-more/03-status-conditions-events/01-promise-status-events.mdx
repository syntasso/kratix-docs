Kratix follows the Kubernetes convention of using status and events to convey important information about a Promise.
Promise Status describes what general condition the Promise is in and surfaces any error that has occurred.

## Conditions

A Promise exposes the following list of conditions:

- `RequirementsFulfilled` – Kratix has installed any required Promises declared by the Promise.
- `ConfigureWorkflowCompleted` – all configure workflow pipelines executed successfully.
- `WorksSucceeded` – all Works created for the Promise has completed.
- `Available` – Promise is ready to accept Resource requests.
- `Reconciled` – Promise has been successfully reconciled; set to true when all the above conditions are all true.

Example Promise conditions from `kubectl get promise <name> -o yaml`:

```yaml
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-06-23T14:02:27Z"
    message: Requirements fulfilled
    reason: RequirementsInstalled
    status: "True"
    type: RequirementsFulfilled
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-06-23T14:07:23Z"
    message: Pipelines completed
    reason: PipelinesExecutedSuccessfully
    status: "True"
    type: ConfigureWorkflowCompleted
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-06-23T14:02:40Z"
    message: All works associated with this promise are ready
    reason: WorksSucceeded
    status: "True"
    type: WorksSucceeded
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-06-23T14:07:26Z"
    message: Ready to fulfil resource requests
    reason: PromiseAvailable
    status: "True"
    type: Available
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-06-23T14:07:26Z"
    message: Reconciled
    reason: Reconciled
    status: "True"
    type: Reconciled
```

Inspect the current Promise status at any time with:

```bash
kubectl describe promise <name>
```

## Common Promise Status Fields

- `apiVersion` – Shows the API version that this Promise is serving requests at.
- `kind` – Shows the Kind that this Promise is serving.
- `lastAvailableTime` – When this Promise becomes available.
- `status` – Whether the Promise is ready to accept Resource requests; can be set to 'Available' or 'Unavailable'.

```yaml
status:
  apiVersion: test.kratix.io/v1alpha1
  kind: Redis
  lastAvailableTime: "2025-06-23T15:34:32Z"
  status: Available
  conditions:
  ...
```

## Events

Events record important moments in the Promise lifecycle such as when requirements are installed,
if the configure pipeline is running and when the Promise becomes available.

They can be viewed using:

```bash
kubectl describe promise <name>
```

These events are useful for understanding the progression of the Promise and troubleshooting failures.
