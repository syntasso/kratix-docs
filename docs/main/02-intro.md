# Introduction

Kratix is the open-source Platform Framework, that enables you to provide anything as-a-Service, while incorporating your key business processes and managing everything as a fleet.

## Why Kratix?

Kratix is designed and built by a team with decades of experience creating [internal developer platforms](https://www.syntasso.io/internal-developer-platforms). We've learned that great platforms address three key challenges faced by enterprise organisations: 

- **Slow delivery of value** because software engineers must wait weeks for other teams to process their tickets.
- **Inconsistent application of key business rules** as teams create shadow IT systems to bypass lengthy ticket queues, introducing business risk.
- **Tech sprawl leading to operational overhead** as SRE, DevOps, and Platform Teams spend their time maintaining services and infrastructure instead of improving them.

A [Kratix Promise](./03-reference/11-promises/01-intro.md) enables you to provide anything-as-a-service, eliminating the need for engineers to wait for manual ticket processing.

[Workflows](./03-reference/12-workflows.md) let you embed any business rule into your Promise definition, from security scans and billing checks to manual approvals.

And with Kratix's built-in [Fleet Management](./03-reference/11-promises/03-updates.md) capabilities, you can maintain and upgrade all your resources with a single click.
