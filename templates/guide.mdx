Introductory paragraph providing the user with an overview of what the guide will cover. What is the end result of following the guide? They
may achieve:
- This goal
- This goal too
- and one more

## Pre-requisites

You will need:
1. Any tools on their machine that the user will not be able to proceed without
1. Any required infrastructure
1. Any additional objects such as secrets in their cluster

## The first heading

Use headings to provide an indication of the small goals the users will achieve as they work through. The can also help with wayfinding if
anyone is interrupted as they progress - as people often are.

Another benefit of the headings is that they are high-priority search results when using the search bar so a well-placed heading could help
unlock a reader goal.

## The next heading

And some content.

## One more heading and things to give guides some pizzazz

### Pictures and diagrams

An image or diagram can both break up any walls of text and help users process the content on the page with greater speed and ease.

Interesting reading about the role of images in processing:
- [Pictorial illustrations still improve students' learning from
  text](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Russell-Carney/publication/263116114_Pictorial_Illustrations_Still_Improve_Students'_Learning_from_Text/links/02e7e51754d7237561000000/Pictorial-Illustrations-Still-Improve-Students-Learning-from-Text.pdf)
- [Picture This: Studying the Effectiveness of Illustrated Instructions](https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/articles/8910k362j)

But when using images, they must be sure to be relevant to the context they're in, comprehensible to the intended audience and accessible.

The example below uses alt text which can make the content more accessible to those using a screen reader. This can be useful but an even
greater benefit can be describing the upcoming image in body of the text, e.g. As seen in the below screenshot of the Terraform Cloud UI,
two outputs were produced; the s3_bucket_bucket_regional_domain_name and the s3_bucket_id.

```mdx-code-block
import TerraformOutputs from "./terraform-outputs.png"
```

<figure className="diagram">
  <img className="large" src={TerraformOutputs} alt="A screen shot of the Terraform UI with the s3_bucket_bucket_regional_domain_name and s3_bucket_id values detailed as outputs" />

  <figcaption>Terraform Outputs</figcaption>
</figure>

### Code samples

Code samples are typically executable or explanatory. When they are only the latter, ensure that this is very clear to the user.

Interesting reading:
- Integrating Code Samples - Docs for Developers 
- [Writing great examples](https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/07/08/writing-great-examples/)
- [Creating Sample Code](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/two/sample-code)

### Admonishments

As the docs are built with Docusaurus, there are a handful of [Admonishments](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/admonitions) that
can be used to call out important information. 

These can be helpful to note useful tips, flags to guard against errors and opportunities to find out more e.g.

## 🎉 Congratulations

✅&nbsp;&nbsp; If they made it this far the user has achieved something, summarise that in a one liner e.g. Bravo! You have successfully
created a Promise from a Terraform module! It can create infrastructure based on inputs from requests, produce outputs and surface these to
users in the status of the request.<br />

## Next steps

If there is a natural follow-up action or area of investigation that would be beneficial to the user, highlight it:
