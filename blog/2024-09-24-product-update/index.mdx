Hi friends 😊 I'm Cat, Product Manager here at Syntasso, and I've been listening
to you, our avid followers. "Cat, we love Kratix, and we love your team; we want
an update!" I hear you scream, so here I am, delivering this top-quality
content. You're welcome.

Given that this is our first Kratix Product Update™ (not really ™), I wanted to
shout about some of the great work the team has done over the last few months,
so we're going back a bit further than we usually will… Indulge me; it was my
birthday this month.

## TL;DR

</p>

If you only have 10 seconds spare to read this blog, these are the features you
need to know about:

* We have two CLIs now! One for building promises and one for installing SKE (Syntasso Kratix Enterprise)
* Setting permissions just got a little bit easier
* If you like Backstage, you’ll like what we’re up to

## Big stuff for the fans of Kratix

### Kratix Promise building CLI

Like all good tools for developers, we needed a CLI - and one that is more than
just a rat nest of bash scripts*. It's now even easier to quickly whip together
a Promise from scratch, or your existing **operators** and **helm charts**.


It's unbelievably easy to get started. Head over to our kratix-cli repo,
download the latest release and go wild. You can read up on the tool in our docs
as well!

*no offence meant to rats, their nests, or bash scripts that resemble said nests


### SKE Operator

Our enterprise product, [Syntasso Kratix Enterprise
(SKE)](https://www.syntasso.io/pricing), comes with a bunch of cool features
that makes it mega easy to get started, including integrations with Backstage,
Terraform Enterprise and now, super speedy installation via our [helm
chart](https://docs.kratix.io/ske/kratix/helm-installation) and the
[ske-cli](https://docs.kratix.io/ske/kratix/ske-cli-installation).

This will pull in some really cool stuff - it can help manage  upgrading Kratix,
check if those upgrades worked, and help you with rollbacks.

If you want to try it out, ping us an email at kratix@syntasso.io, and we’ll
hook you up 😎

## Neat stuff (because security should not be YOLO!)

### Security uplift

So security is hard. We’ve made this a little bit easier in two ways.

#### RBAC permissions for your pipelines

You can set the RBAC permissions you want all your pipelines to have in the promise spec. There are a few ways you can do this depending on your use of service accounts and namespaces, so check out our docs.

This will give you as the promise writer more control of the permissions of your pipelines without having to manually set things up after applying a promise.

```yaml
platform: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: Promise
metadata:
  name: env
spec:
  ...
  workflows:
    resource:
      configure:
      - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
        kind: Pipeline
        metadata:
          name: slack-notify
        spec:
          rbac:
            permissions:
              - apiGroups: [""]
                verbs: ["*"]
                resources: ["secrets"]
              - apiGroups: ["batch"]
                verbs: ["get"]
                resources: ["jobs"]
                resourceName: ["my-job"]
        ...
```

#### Security Contexts for Your Pods

By default, Kratix-owned pods have security contexts set with all the privileges they need. Any containers provided by a Promise author got NOTHING. I didn’t say Kratix was a fair project.

But we have just got a little fairer. You can now set security contexts for your own pods by specifying it in the container spec. Perhaps more excitingly, you can now specify a global default security context in the Kratix ConfigMap in the kratix-platform-system. Fire Configure and forget 🔥

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kratix
  namespace: kratix-platform-system
data:
  config: |
    workflows:
      defaultContainerSecurityContext:
        # Security context fields, e.g.:
        runAsNonRoot: false
```

> _I think it is much better_ 👍

## More control over Backstage (with Kratix)

If you know anything about Syntasso, it's that we love Backstage. We even did a
webinar with one of their product managers, the insightful Seve Kim.

We believe Kratix and Backstage work so beautifully together that our SKE
offering comes bundled with plugins that make managing Promises and Resources
from Backstage a joyful experience. This month, we've given users even more
control in two ways.

Promise authors can now provide an "info" field as part of the Promise spec that
will show up on your component page. This field supports markdown and has far
too much space to let your users know whatever will make their day a little
easier.

We have also made the first page of requesting a resource more configurable - we
know not every end user will understand what their "namespace" should be (even
though it is very important for knowing where we should put that resource!!) so
you can configure that to whatever makes sense for your team. You can even go
full abstraction and get rid of it entirely and pre-populate it with whatever
you want. The sky's the limit.

```mdx-code-block
import Backstage from "./backstage.webp"
```
