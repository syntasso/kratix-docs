Ever wondered how Kratix actually gets your documents from the Platform Cluster
to the correct Destination?

The Kratix Team has recently introduced a
[change](https://github.com/syntasso/kratix/pull/243) to
Kratix to reduce the size of the Work object. While this change is mostly
internal, we wanted to share how the innards of Kratix work.

So brace yourself to learn:
- how Kratix moves documents from Platform to Destinations
- what works and workplacements are
- how to inspect works to debug your Promises

You are probably already familiar with how Kratix works at a high level and with
the diagram below:

<figure className="diagram">
  <img className="large" src={Figure01} alt="High level diagram explaining how
Kratix processes requests" />

  <figcaption>How Kratix processes a request to a Kubernetes Destination</figcaption>
</figure>

As illustrated above:

1. The user sends a new **App Request** to the Platform Cluster.
2. The **Promise** reacts to that request and triggers the **Resource Configure
   Workflows**.
3. The Workflow completes and outputs a **series of documents** to be scheduled
   to a **Destination**.
4. These documents are written to a specific directory in the **State Store**.
5. In the diagram, the documents are scheduled to a Kubernetes **Destination**.
   These type of Destination usually have Flux (or ArgoCD, or another GitOps
   tool) watching the State Store. The tool picks up the new documents.
6. The documents are then processed and applied to the Destination.
7. The **App** becomes operational on the Destination.

In this post, I'm going to expand on points (3) and (4): what happens at the end
of the Workflow? How is the document written to the State Store? And how does
the change linked above affect this process?

If the diagram is new to you, I recommend checking out the [Part I of the
Kratix Workshop](http://localhost:3000/workshop/part-i/intro) for an overview of
Kratix.

## A Dive into Kratix Internals

The casual observers among you may have noticed that, when installing Kratix, a
couple of CRDs are also created but not prominently mentioned in the guides
or workshops: the **Work** and the **WorkPlacement**.

The **Work** CRD contains the definition of, well, a Work. All the documents
output by a workflow are captured in the Work Object as **workloads**. Each
document corresponds to a workload entry in the Work object. These workloads are
grouped by the **destination selectors** specified by both the Workflow and the
Promise.

In other words, the Work object encapsulates everything needed to schedule the
workloads to the Destinations.

:::info How does the Work gets created?

Keen observers may have notice the few extra containers that are included in the
Workflow Job. One of these containers is called `work-writer`. As the name
suggests, it handles creating the Work object at the end of the Workflow. ðŸ˜‰

:::

One of the controllers bundled with Kratix is the **Work Controller**. This
controller is responsible for finding out all the available Destinations and
selecting the right one for each workload in a Work. It achieves this by
monitoring Work objects and creating a **WorkPlacement** object for each
workload.

:::tip What if there's no Destination to schedule a workload?

The Work Controller marks the Work as **Unscheduled**. You can verify this by
checking the `Scheduled` condition in the `status` field of the Work Object.

Once a Destination becomes available, the system will automatically try to
schedule any unscheduled Work.

:::

The **WorkPlacement** object serves as a link between a Work (or specifically, a
workload group within the Work) and a Destination. It contains a copy of the
Workloads and information about the Destination it is scheduled to.

The WorkPlacement controller reacts to WorkPlacements and ensures the workloads
are written to the State Store associated with the Destination.

The diagram below illustrates the Work and WorkPlacement objects in details:

<figure className="diagram">
  <img className="large" src={Figure02} alt="A Work with two workloads, from
    which two WorkPlacements are generated" />

  <figcaption>A Work generating two WorkPlacements</figcaption>
</figure>

In summary:

* The contents of a Workflow output are combined into a single Work object. Each
  document has an associated `workload` entry in the Work.
* Workloads are grouped by the destination selectors specified by the Workflow
  and the Promise.
* From the Work object, a WorkPlacement is created for each Workload group.
* The WorkPlacement controller writes the Workloads to the State Store
  associated with the Destination.
* ðŸŽ‰

That means the Work object can get quite large, since it's combining all the
documents into a single object. But how large is too large?

## Reaching etcd limits

The answer is about 1.5MB. While the Kubernetes API accepts up to 3MB of data in
a single request, etcd only persist keys up to 1.5MB (by default). Although this
is configurable, it's fair to assume that most clusters where Kratix is deployed
will use the default settings.

So what happens if a Work object exceeds 1.5MB? The Configure Workflow fails at
the `work-writer` container, and the error message isn't particularly helpful:

```shell-session
etcdserver: request is too large
```

:::tip

You may see an error message like `Request entity too large: limit is
3145728`; that means you are hitting the Kubernetes API limit, not the etcd
one.

:::

While it takes a lot of YAML to be over 1.5MB, you can easily reach such a limit
in your Promise. The [Prometheus
Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator), for
example, includes 3.7MB of YAML!

This brings us back to the [change introduced by
243](https://github.com/syntasso/kratix/pull/243). In this update, we introduced
gzip compression for the Workload contents before persisting the Work into etcd.
This significantly reduces the size of the Work object (gzip documentation
mentions an average of [70% reduction in
size](https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/manual/gzip.html)). For the Prometheus
Operator, for example, the size of the Work object went from 3.7MB to about
490KBâ€”an 87% reduction ðŸŽ‰!

The downside? If you inspect the Work object, youâ€™ll see base64-encoded binary
data instead of some nice to read YAML.

<figure className="diagram">
  <img className="large" src={Figure03} alt="Screenshot of a terminal showing
  the Work object with binary data in the contents of a Workload" />

  <figcaption>A compressed Work Object</figcaption>
</figure>

You can still read it though. To inspect a workloadâ€™s contents, decode the
base64 data, then unzip it using this command:

```shell-session
kubectl get work <work-name> \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.workloadGroups[0].workloads[0].content}' \
  | base64 -d \
  | gzip -d
```

<figure className="diagram">
  <img className="large" src={Figure04} alt="Screenshot of a terminal showing
  the decompressed contents of a workload from a Work object" />

  <figcaption>A decompressed workload</figcaption>
</figure>

:::tip

Check our [Troubleshooting guide](/main/troubleshooting) for more information on
how to debug Kratix, including inspecting Works and WorkPlacements.

:::

Despite compression, large Work objects may still pose challenges. While this
update provides temporary relief, weâ€™ll need to revisit the structure to allow
users to have unbounded fun with their Promises. But thatâ€™s a story for another
day.

## Conclusion

In this post, we dived into the internals of Kratix to understand how a
document moves from the Platform Cluster to a Destination. We saw how the
Work and WorkPlacement objects are used to schedule and write documents to the
State Store. We also saw how the recent change to compress the Workload
contents has helped reduce the size of the Work object.

We hope this post has given you a better understanding of how Kratix works under
the hood. If you have any questions or feedback (or want to see more blog posts
