Rolling out [changes across a platform fleet](https://www.syntasso.io/post/fleet-management-what-platform-engineering-can-learn-from-over-the-air-car-updates)
 is one of the hardest parts of being a platform engineer. Move too fast, and you risk availability. Move too slowly, and the platform becomes a bottleneck.


Imagine you are responsible for maintaining a suite of production services. Some support apps that are more business critical 
than others - maybe they are customer facing, or back time-sensitive business functions. You receive a notification of a vulnerability that you need
  to patch. How do you ensure that upgrades to those business critical services are successful and won’t cause downtime or outages? 

<!-- truncate -->

Today, we’re introducing Kratix [Promise Revisions](/main/reference/promises/promise-upgrade/promise-revisions) 
and [Resource Bindings](/main/reference/promises/promise-upgrade/resource-bindings), a new way to control how 
upgrades roll out across your Kratix fleet. You decide which resources are upgraded, when they are upgraded, and how to roll back if 
something does not behave as expected.

This removes the risk from (often ad-hoc) platform upgrades and puts control firmly back in the hands of platform teams.

## Why should I care about fleet upgrades?

At Syntasso, we have been talking about [fleet management](https://www.syntasso.io/blog-all-posts/tags/fleet-management) 
for a while. We believe platforms only succeed long-term if they can incrementally support double, triple, or 10x the 
number of resources without increasing platform-team headcount. 

Our customers agree.

“We like the concept of a fleet,” said one large banking customer. Music to our ears!

But they also told us: “But I'm not sure whether it's a good idea to just silently upgrade 50 databases at once.”

That concern is very real. A platform is the beating heart of an engineering organisation. If upgrades are applied too broadly, 
or at the wrong time, the impact can ripple across teams and environments. 
In Kratix terms fleet-wide upgrades can dramatically improve consistency and velocity. But without proper controls 
they also increase risk around availability, safety, and trust in the platform.

With the latest Kratix and [Syntasso Kratix Enterprise (SKE)](/ske) release fleet upgrades become significantly safer.

Using Promise Revisions and Resource Bindings platform engineers can control exactly which resources receive an update and 
when, enabling gradual rollouts, canaries, and fast rollbacks.


### The benefits of Promise Revisions and Resource Bindings

With Promise Revisions and Resource Bindings, platform teams can define upgrade strategies that match how their organisation actually operates:
- Upgrade a single canary resource first then roll out to the remaining resources if the canary remains healthy
- Update development environments to the latest version while holding production back until you are ready
- Quickly roll back to a previous version if an upgrade does not behave as expected

## How Kratix enables safe resource upgrades

### Versioned Promises and Promise Revisions

Every time a versioned Promise is installed Kratix creates a [Promise Revision](/main/reference/promises/promise-upgrade/promise-revisions). 
A Promise Revision is a snapshot of the Promise at that point in time.

You can retain as many revisions as you like, giving you:
- A clear audit trail of which Promise versions have existed on your platform
- Visibility into what changed between versions
- A stable reference point for upgrades and rollbacks

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: PromiseRevision
metadata:
  labels:
    kratix.io/promise-name: promise-name
  name: promise-revision-name
  # Name of the Promise Revision; this takes the form <PROMISE_NAME>-<VERSION>
spec:
  promiseRef:
    name: promise-name
  promiseSpec:
  # The full promise.spec of the Promise
    api:
    destinationSelectors:
    workflows:
  version: v0.1.0
  # The version of the Promise as indicated by the kratix.io/promise-version label
status: {}
```
### Resource Bindings for precise control
When a resource is created, Kratix now creates a [Resource Binding](/main/reference/promises/promise-upgrade/resource-bindings) 
that maps that resource to the latest Promise Revision. 

Platform engineers can update this binding at any time to point to a different revision. This allows you to:
- Control which resources receive upgrades and when
- Roll resources back to a known-good version
- See exactly which resources are running on which Promise Revision with a single command

This makes the state of your fleet of resources explicit and observable, rather than implicit and risky.

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: ResourceBinding
metadata:
  labels:
    kratix.io/promise-name: redis # name of the Promise
    kratix.io/resource-name: example # name of the Resource
  name: example-redis-e7f90
  namespace: default # Resource Bindings are created in the same namespace as the Resource itself
spec:
  promiseRef:
    name: redis # name of the Promise
  resourceRef:
    name: example # name of the Resource
    namespace: default # namespace of the Resource
  version: latest # version of the Promise this Resource is associated to
```

### Safe, staged fleet upgrades
By combining Promise Revisions and Resource Bindings, platform engineers can group resources and control how upgrades move through the fleet. 
Upgrades no longer have to be all-or-nothing. You can roll changes out gradually, validate behaviour, and expand confidence before 
widening the blast radius.

For advanced Kratix users, this is just the beginning. By layering in [health checks](/main/guides/resource-health), you can build automated canary and progressive 
rollout strategies. We will be sharing a deeper dive into this pattern in an upcoming blog post.
