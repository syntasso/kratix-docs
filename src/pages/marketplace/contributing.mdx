# How to contribute a Promise

The Kratix Marketplace is a place where you can share and find Promises, built
by the community, for the community. If you'd like to contribute a Promise, you
can do so by creating a Pull Request to the [Kratix
Docs repository](https://github.com/syntasso/kratix-docs). The list of Promises
is stored in the `src/data/promise-data.ts` file.

You can add your Promise to the list using the following template:

```typescript
{
  name: 'Promise Name',
  description: 'Promise Description',
  url: 'https://github.com/org/repository',
  logoUrl: 'image.svg',
  categories: ['Category 1', 'Category 2']
}
```

## Promise structure

There's no specific structure required for your Promise to be accepted, neither a
particular repository where the Promise should be stored. For inspiration, you can take
a look at the [Promises authored by Syntasso](https://github.com/syntasso/kratix-marketplace).

## When will my Promise be available?

Once the PR is submitted, it will be reviewed and tested by the Kratix team. Once merged,
it should be available on the Marketplace within minutes.
